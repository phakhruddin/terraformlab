The reason you're seeing only the "kube" pods and not the Kubernetes pods on Docker Desktop could be due to the **context** in which `kubectl` is operating. Kubernetes can have multiple clusters and contexts configured, and `kubectl` interacts with a specific cluster or context based on the current configuration.

Here are a few potential causes and solutions:

### 1\. **Context Mismatch**:

If you have both Kubernetes running on Docker Desktop and a separate Kubernetes setup (e.g., "kube" pods) on the same Mac, `kubectl` may be pointing to the wrong Kubernetes context. To verify which context `kubectl` is using, you can run:

```bash
kubectl config current-context
```

This will show the current context being used by `kubectl`. If it’s pointing to the Kubernetes setup on your Mac rather than Docker Desktop, you will see the pods from that specific cluster only.

### Solution:

You can switch to the Docker Desktop Kubernetes context with the following command (assuming Docker Desktop is the context name):

```bash
kubectl config use-context docker-desktop
```

After switching, try running the `kubectl get pods` command again:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

### 2\. **Cluster Configuration Issue**:

If Docker Desktop’s Kubernetes is not properly started or the cluster is misconfigured, `kubectl` may not be able to access or list the Kubernetes pods.

### Solution:

*   Verify that Docker Desktop's Kubernetes is running:
    *   Open Docker Desktop on your Mac and check the Kubernetes tab to ensure the Kubernetes cluster is enabled and running.
    *   You can restart the cluster from Docker Desktop if needed.

### 3\. **Namespace Limitation**:

Kubernetes organizes resources like pods into namespaces, and by default, `kubectl get pods` lists pods only in the **default** namespace.

### Solution:

Try listing all pods across all namespaces:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

This will show pods running in other namespaces, including system namespaces like `kube-system`.

### 4\. **Different Kubeconfig Files**:

It's possible that `kubectl` is using a different `kubeconfig` file for the other Kubernetes cluster running on your Mac, and not the one configured for Docker Desktop.

### Solution:

To check which kubeconfig file is being used, you can run:

```bash
echo $KUBECONFIG
```

If it's not using the default `~/.kube/config`, or if you have multiple configurations, ensure Docker Desktop's kubeconfig is merged correctly.

You can also explicitly specify the `kubeconfig` file for Docker Desktop using:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/docker-desktop-config
```

After ensuring you're using the correct context, namespaces, and cluster setup, you should be able to see the Kubernetes pods from Docker Desktop.
