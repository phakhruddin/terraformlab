# Splunk Terraform Lab

To create a Terraform configuration that adds a saved search alert to Splunk, you can use the `splunk` provider. If this provider does not exist or you prefer not to use it, you'll need to rely on a custom `null_resource` or `local-exec` to interact with Splunk’s REST API directly.

Here's an example of how you can structure your Terraform configuration using a `local-exec` that interacts with Splunk’s API to create a saved search alert:

### Prerequisites:
- Splunk REST API access enabled
- Authentication tokens or admin credentials
- `curl` command-line tool available

### Example Terraform Code to Create a Saved Search Alert:

```hcl
provider "null" {}

variable "splunk_username" {
  description = "Splunk admin username"
  type        = string
}

variable "splunk_password" {
  description = "Splunk admin password"
  type        = string
}

variable "splunk_host" {
  description = "Splunk server hostname or IP"
  type        = string
}

variable "splunk_saved_search_name" {
  description = "Name of the saved search alert"
  type        = string
}

variable "splunk_search_query" {
  description = "The SPL query for the saved search alert"
  type        = string
}

variable "splunk_alert_action" {
  description = "Action to trigger when the alert is fired"
  type        = string
  default     = "email"
}

variable "splunk_alert_email" {
  description = "Email address for the alert"
  type        = string
}

resource "null_resource" "create_splunk_alert" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<EOT
      curl -k -u "${var.splunk_username}:${var.splunk_password}" \
      -d "name=${var.splunk_saved_search_name}" \
      -d "search=${var.splunk_search_query}" \
      -d "alert_type=always" \
      -d "alert_threshold=1" \
      -d "alert_comparator=greater than" \
      -d "actions=${var.splunk_alert_action}" \
      -d "action.email.to=${var.splunk_alert_email}" \
      -X POST https://${var.splunk_host}:8089/services/saved/searches
    EOT
  }

  triggers = {
    splunk_saved_search_name = var.splunk_saved_search_name
    splunk_search_query      = var.splunk_search_query
  }
}

output "splunk_saved_search" {
  value = "${var.splunk_saved_search_name} alert created."
}
```

### Breakdown:
- **Variables**: Used for Splunk credentials, host, alert name, query, and alert actions.
- **`null_resource` and `local-exec`**: Executes a `curl` command to the Splunk API to create a saved search.
- **Alert Parameters**: Can be customized based on your use case, including alert actions and conditions.
- **Trigger**: This ensures that the saved search alert is created whenever the search name or query changes.

### Steps to Use:
1. Replace the variables with actual values or provide them through Terraform’s `-var` option.
2. Apply the Terraform plan to create the alert in Splunk.

This setup uses the `services/saved/searches` API endpoint in Splunk, which is used to manage saved searches, including alerts.

change the above to terraform "splunk" provider where it initiates rest api call to splunk searchhead with rest user

To achieve this with a Terraform provider that directly interacts with Splunk's REST API, you'd need to define a custom provider that can handle the interactions with Splunk. Unfortunately, as of now, there is no official Terraform `splunk` provider that manages Splunk resources natively. However, I can help you construct a `null_resource` provisioner approach, but using a custom `REST API` call with a REST user instead of the `local-exec` provisioner.

Let’s adjust the code to simulate the use of a `splunk` provider, while still invoking the REST API using `local-exec` provisioners. The idea is to make the process more abstract, and you would define the interaction logic while using Terraform.

Here's how the configuration could look using a more generic REST user and REST API interactions, reflecting how this could work with a theoretical provider or provisioner.

### Terraform Code using Custom REST API Calls with a REST User

```hcl
provider "null" {}

variable "splunk_username" {
  description = "Splunk REST user username"
  type        = string
}

variable "splunk_password" {
  description = "Splunk REST user password"
  type        = string
}

variable "splunk_host" {
  description = "Splunk Search Head hostname or IP"
  type        = string
}

variable "splunk_saved_search_name" {
  description = "Name of the saved search alert"
  type        = string
}

variable "splunk_search_query" {
  description = "The SPL query for the saved search alert"
  type        = string
}

variable "splunk_alert_action" {
  description = "Action to trigger when the alert is fired"
  type        = string
  default     = "email"
}

variable "splunk_alert_email" {
  description = "Email address for the alert"
  type        = string
}

# Create a saved search alert on Splunk Search Head
resource "null_resource" "create_splunk_alert" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<EOT
      curl -k -u "${var.splunk_username}:${var.splunk_password}" \
      -d "name=${var.splunk_saved_search_name}" \
      -d "search=${var.splunk_search_query}" \
      -d "alert_type=always" \
      -d "alert_threshold=1" \
      -d "alert_comparator=greater than" \
      -d "actions=${var.splunk_alert_action}" \
      -d "action.email.to=${var.splunk_alert_email}" \
      -X POST https://${var.splunk_host}:8089/services/saved/searches
    EOT
  }

  triggers = {
    splunk_saved_search_name = var.splunk_saved_search_name
    splunk_search_query      = var.splunk_search_query
  }
}

output "splunk_saved_search" {
  value = "${var.splunk_saved_search_name} alert created successfully."
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Rest API Call with REST User**: This example uses a REST user to authenticate and interact with the Splunk Search Head. The username and password are provided as Terraform variables, and the `local-exec` provisioner makes the `POST` request to create the saved search alert.
2. **Abstracted REST API Interaction**: While there's no actual Splunk Terraform provider, the `null_resource` is used to simulate a resource that triggers the API interaction through `local-exec`. This is where you could imagine the Splunk provider interacting if it existed.
3. **Splunk REST API Call**: The `curl` command in the provisioner sends the saved search creation request to Splunk's API using the REST user credentials.

### Next Steps:
If a future Splunk provider becomes available, you can switch to it by defining resources similar to this structure, but for now, this is an effective method of managing saved search alerts via Terraform.

Would you like to proceed with this approach, or would you like further customization?

please use the syntax as outline here https://registry.terraform.io/providers/splunk/splunk/latest/docs

To create a saved search alert using the official Splunk Terraform provider, you can use the `splunk_saved_searches` resource. Below is an example Terraform configuration that sets up a saved search alert within Splunk using the correct provider syntax:

### Example Terraform Configuration:

```hcl
provider "splunk" {
  url      = "https://<SPLUNK_HOST>:8089"
  username = var.splunk_username
  password = var.splunk_password
}

resource "splunk_saved_searches" "alert" {
  name   = var.splunk_saved_search_name
  search = var.splunk_search_query

  # Optional settings for saved search alert
  alert_type     = "always"
  alert_actions  = [var.splunk_alert_action]
  alert_condition = "eventcount > 0"

  # Alert action settings
  action.email.to = var.splunk_alert_email

  # Define the schedule for the search to run
  cron_schedule = "*/5 * * * *"

  # Additional options
  is_scheduled = true
  actions      = [var.splunk_alert_action]
}
```

### Variables:
- `splunk_username`, `splunk_password`: Splunk REST API credentials (use environment variables or store them securely).
- `splunk_saved_search_name`: The name of the alert.
- `splunk_search_query`: The Splunk search query for the alert.
- `splunk_alert_action`: The alert action (e.g., email, webhook).
- `splunk_alert_email`: Email to send the alert to.

### Steps:
1. Replace `<SPLUNK_HOST>` with your actual Splunk server URL.
2. Customize the query, alert action, and conditions according to your use case.

This configuration uses the `splunk_saved_searches` resource from the Splunk provider to manage saved searches and alerts programmatically. You can find more details about configuring the saved searches on the [Splunk Terraform provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/splunk/splunk/latest/docs/resources/saved_searches) [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/splunk/splunk/latest/docs#:~:text=URL%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fregistry,100) [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/splunk/splunk/latest#:~:text=URL%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fregistry,100).

## modify the code by defining the alert parameter in user defined yaml file as an input parameter

To modify the Terraform configuration to use a YAML file for input parameters like the search query, alert name, and other alert configuration, we can read the YAML file using the `terraform` provider’s `file` and `yamldecode` functions. Here’s how you can implement it.

### Steps:
1. Create a YAML file that defines the alert parameters.
2. Use `yamldecode()` to parse the YAML file in Terraform and apply the parameters to your `splunk_saved_searches` resource.

### Example YAML file (`alert_config.yaml`):

```yaml
alert:
  name: "MyAlert"
  search_query: "index=_internal | stats count by sourcetype"
  alert_type: "always"
  alert_action: "email"
  alert_email: "user@example.com"
  cron_schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
  alert_condition: "eventcount > 0"
```

### Updated Terraform Configuration:

```hcl
provider "splunk" {
  url      = "https://<SPLUNK_HOST>:8089"
  username = var.splunk_username
  password = var.splunk_password
}

# Read the YAML file and decode it into a map
locals {
  alert_config = yamldecode(file("${path.module}/alert_config.yaml"))
}

resource "splunk_saved_searches" "alert" {
  name   = local.alert_config.alert.name
  search = local.alert_config.alert.search_query

  # Optional settings for saved search alert
  alert_type      = local.alert_config.alert.alert_type
  alert_actions   = [local.alert_config.alert.alert_action]
  alert_condition = local.alert_config.alert.alert_condition

  # Alert action settings
  action.email.to = local.alert_config.alert.alert_email

  # Define the schedule for the search to run
  cron_schedule = local.alert_config.alert.cron_schedule

  # Additional options
  is_scheduled = true
  actions      = [local.alert_config.alert.alert_action]
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **YAML File Input**: 
   - A file named `alert_config.yaml` is created to define all the alert parameters.
2. **`yamldecode()` function**:
   - The `yamldecode(file())` function in Terraform reads the YAML file and parses it into a map, which is then used to access individual parameters.
3. **Accessing YAML Parameters**:
   - Each parameter from the YAML file is accessed using `local.alert_config.alert.<parameter_name>`, allowing dynamic configuration based on the input file.

### How to Apply:
1. Create a file named `alert_config.yaml` with the alert configuration in the same directory as your Terraform configuration.
2. Modify the Splunk server host and credentials in the Terraform code.
3. Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` to create the alert using the parameters from the YAML file.

This approach provides flexibility for defining and managing multiple alert configurations externally, and it integrates smoothly with Terraform workflows.

## Enhance the above for multiple alert names in the input file and use foreach loop ##

To handle multiple alert configurations in the YAML file and apply them using a `for_each` loop in Terraform, you can adjust the YAML file structure and the Terraform configuration accordingly. Here's how you can enhance your setup:

### Updated YAML File (`alert_config.yaml`):

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "MyAlert1"
    search_query: "index=_internal | stats count by sourcetype"
    alert_type: "always"
    alert_action: "email"
    alert_email: "user1@example.com"
    cron_schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
    alert_condition: "eventcount > 0"

  - name: "MyAlert2"
    search_query: "index=main | stats count by host"
    alert_type: "always"
    alert_action: "email"
    alert_email: "user2@example.com"
    cron_schedule: "0 * * * *"
    alert_condition: "eventcount > 10"
```

### Updated Terraform Configuration:

```hcl
provider "splunk" {
  url      = "https://<SPLUNK_HOST>:8089"
  username = var.splunk_username
  password = var.splunk_password
}

# Read the YAML file and decode it into a map
locals {
  alert_configs = yamldecode(file("${path.module}/alert_config.yaml")).alerts
}

# Use a foreach loop to create multiple saved searches based on the YAML file input
resource "splunk_saved_searches" "alerts" {
  for_each       = { for alert in local.alert_configs : alert.name => alert }
  name           = each.value.name
  search         = each.value.search_query
  alert_type     = each.value.alert_type
  alert_actions  = [each.value.alert_action]
  alert_condition = each.value.alert_condition

  # Alert action settings
  action.email.to = each.value.alert_email

  # Define the schedule for the search to run
  cron_schedule = each.value.cron_schedule

  # Additional options
  is_scheduled = true
  actions      = [each.value.alert_action]
}

output "splunk_alerts" {
  value = splunk_saved_searches.alerts
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **YAML File Structure**:
   - The YAML now has an array of alerts under the key `alerts`, with each alert configuration as a list item.
2. **Terraform `for_each` Loop**:
   - The `for_each` loop is used in the `splunk_saved_searches` resource to iterate over the alerts defined in the YAML file. The loop uses `each.value` to access the attributes of each alert (name, search query, etc.).
3. **Dynamic Resource Creation**:
   - Each alert in the YAML file corresponds to a dynamically created `splunk_saved_searches` resource using `for_each`.
4. **Output**:
   - The output shows the details of the created alerts.

### How to Apply:
1. Update your YAML file with multiple alert definitions.
2. Adjust the Splunk host and credentials.
3. Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` to create all the alerts based on the YAML file.

This setup allows you to manage multiple saved search alerts through a single YAML file and loop through them in Terraform, making it scalable and easy to maintain.

let say there is additional input variable environment, it differentiate between "prod" or "dev". Please add additional logic so that the alert on run if the env=prod.

To implement the logic where the alerts only run in the "prod" environment, we can add an `environment` variable and use a condition in Terraform to filter out resources based on this value. Below is the enhanced Terraform configuration with the additional environment variable and logic.

### Updated YAML File (`alert_config.yaml`):
The YAML file remains the same:

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "MyAlert1"
    search_query: "index=_internal | stats count by sourcetype"
    alert_type: "always"
    alert_action: "email"
    alert_email: "user1@example.com"
    cron_schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
    alert_condition: "eventcount > 0"

  - name: "MyAlert2"
    search_query: "index=main | stats count by host"
    alert_type: "always"
    alert_action: "email"
    alert_email: "user2@example.com"
    cron_schedule: "0 * * * *"
    alert_condition: "eventcount > 10"
```

### Updated Terraform Configuration:

```hcl
provider "splunk" {
  url      = "https://<SPLUNK_HOST>:8089"
  username = var.splunk_username
  password = var.splunk_password
}

# New input variable for environment
variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Environment (dev or prod)"
}

# Read the YAML file and decode it into a map
locals {
  alert_configs = yamldecode(file("${path.module}/alert_config.yaml")).alerts
}

# Use a foreach loop to create multiple saved searches based on the YAML file input
resource "splunk_saved_searches" "alerts" {
  for_each       = { for alert in local.alert_configs : alert.name => alert if var.environment == "prod" }
  name           = each.value.name
  search         = each.value.search_query
  alert_type     = each.value.alert_type
  alert_actions  = [each.value.alert_action]
  alert_condition = each.value.alert_condition

  # Alert action settings
  action.email.to = each.value.alert_email

  # Define the schedule for the search to run
  cron_schedule = each.value.cron_schedule

  # Additional options
  is_scheduled = true
  actions      = [each.value.alert_action]
}

output "splunk_alerts" {
  value = splunk_saved_searches.alerts
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **New `environment` Variable**:
   - The `environment` variable is added to differentiate between "prod" and "dev" environments.
   - It is defined in the Terraform configuration and can be passed in via `terraform apply -var="environment=prod"` or set in a `terraform.tfvars` file.
   
2. **Conditional Logic in `for_each`**:
   - The `for_each` loop now includes a condition `if var.environment == "prod"`, which ensures that the saved search alerts are only created if the environment is set to `prod`.
   
3. **Filtered Resource Creation**:
   - The loop only creates alerts when the condition is met (`environment == "prod"`). If the environment is "dev", the loop will be skipped, and no alerts will be created.

### How to Apply:
1. Ensure you have the updated YAML file in the correct location.
2. Set the environment variable when running Terraform:
   - For production: `terraform apply -var="environment=prod"`
   - For development: `terraform apply -var="environment=dev"` (This will skip creating the alerts.)
3. The alerts will only be created when the environment is set to "prod".

This setup provides flexibility to manage different environments and ensures alerts are only created when necessary in the production environment.

## Add the logic so that the alert creation only occur if the environment is prod and business is finance.

To include logic so that alerts are created only when the environment is "prod" and the business is "finance," we can extend the condition in the `for_each` loop by introducing another variable called `business`. This will be checked along with `environment` to ensure alerts are created only if both conditions are met.

### Updated YAML File (`alert_config.yaml`):
The YAML remains the same:

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "MyAlert1"
    search_query: "index=_internal | stats count by sourcetype"
    alert_type: "always"
    alert_action: "email"
    alert_email: "user1@example.com"
    cron_schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
    alert_condition: "eventcount > 0"

  - name: "MyAlert2"
    search_query: "index=main | stats count by host"
    alert_type: "always"
    alert_action: "email"
    alert_email: "user2@example.com"
    cron_schedule: "0 * * * *"
    alert_condition: "eventcount > 10"
```

### Updated Terraform Configuration:

```hcl
provider "splunk" {
  url      = "https://<SPLUNK_HOST>:8089"
  username = var.splunk_username
  password = var.splunk_password
}

# Input variables for environment and business
variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Environment (dev or prod)"
}

variable "business" {
  type        = string
  description = "Business unit (e.g., finance, sales)"
}

# Read the YAML file and decode it into a map
locals {
  alert_configs = yamldecode(file("${path.module}/alert_config.yaml")).alerts
}

# Use a foreach loop to create multiple saved searches based on the YAML file input
resource "splunk_saved_searches" "alerts" {
  # Only create the alert if the environment is prod and business is finance
  for_each = { for alert in local.alert_configs : alert.name => alert if var.environment == "prod" && var.business == "finance" }

  name           = each.value.name
  search         = each.value.search_query
  alert_type     = each.value.alert_type
  alert_actions  = [each.value.alert_action]
  alert_condition = each.value.alert_condition

  # Alert action settings
  action.email.to = each.value.alert_email

  # Define the schedule for the search to run
  cron_schedule = each.value.cron_schedule

  # Additional options
  is_scheduled = true
  actions      = [each.value.alert_action]
}

output "splunk_alerts" {
  value = splunk_saved_searches.alerts
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **New `business` Variable**:
   - A new `business` variable is added to differentiate between different business units such as "finance" or others.
   
2. **Conditional Logic**:
   - The `for_each` loop condition is extended to check both `var.environment == "prod"` and `var.business == "finance"`.
   - Alerts will only be created if both conditions are true. If the environment is "dev" or the business is not "finance", the alerts won't be created.

3. **Filtered Resource Creation**:
   - The loop filters the alert creation based on the environment and business variables, ensuring the saved searches are only created when these match the desired values.

### How to Apply:
1. Set the environment and business variables when running Terraform:
   - For production and finance: `terraform apply -var="environment=prod" -var="business=finance"`
   - For development or other business units, no alerts will be created (e.g., `terraform apply -var="environment=dev" -var="business=sales"`).
2. The alerts will only be created when the environment is "prod" and the business is "finance".

This approach allows you to manage environment-specific and business-specific alert creation, adding more flexibility to your Terraform code.

## Add logic using "can" function not to fail the alert creation if the parameter is missing or empty.

In Terraform, the `can()` function can be used to prevent failures when accessing missing or empty parameters. It checks whether a value or expression can be accessed and returns a boolean, allowing you to safely handle missing or empty parameters without causing Terraform to fail.

Here’s how you can modify the Terraform configuration to ensure that missing or empty parameters do not cause the alert creation to fail:

### Updated Terraform Configuration with `can()`:

```hcl
provider "splunk" {
  url      = "https://<SPLUNK_HOST>:8089"
  username = var.splunk_username
  password = var.splunk_password
}

# Input variables for environment and business
variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Environment (dev or prod)"
}

variable "business" {
  type        = string
  description = "Business unit (e.g., finance, sales)"
}

# Read the YAML file and decode it into a map
locals {
  alert_configs = yamldecode(file("${path.module}/alert_config.yaml")).alerts
}

# Use a foreach loop to create multiple saved searches based on the YAML file input
resource "splunk_saved_searches" "alerts" {
  # Only create the alert if the environment is prod and business is finance
  for_each = { for alert in local.alert_configs : alert.name => alert if var.environment == "prod" && var.business == "finance" }

  name           = each.value.name
  search         = can(each.value.search_query) ? each.value.search_query : "index=_internal | stats count by sourcetype"  # Default search query
  alert_type     = can(each.value.alert_type) ? each.value.alert_type : "always"  # Default to always alert
  alert_actions  = can(each.value.alert_action) ? [each.value.alert_action] : ["email"]  # Default alert action
  alert_condition = can(each.value.alert_condition) ? each.value.alert_condition : "eventcount > 0"  # Default condition

  # Alert action settings
  action.email.to = can(each.value.alert_email) ? each.value.alert_email : "default@example.com"  # Default email

  # Define the schedule for the search to run
  cron_schedule = can(each.value.cron_schedule) ? each.value.cron_schedule : "*/5 * * * *"  # Default schedule

  # Additional options
  is_scheduled = true
  actions      = [each.value.alert_action]
}

output "splunk_alerts" {
  value = splunk_saved_searches.alerts
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Using `can()` to Safely Access Parameters**:
   - The `can()` function is applied to each potentially missing or empty parameter (`search_query`, `alert_type`, `alert_action`, `alert_email`, `alert_condition`, `cron_schedule`).
   - If a parameter is missing or empty, a default value is used instead to ensure that the alert creation doesn't fail.

2. **Default Values**:
   - If a parameter is missing or empty, the following default values are used:
     - `search_query`: `"index=_internal | stats count by sourcetype"`
     - `alert_type`: `"always"`
     - `alert_action`: `"email"`
     - `alert_condition`: `"eventcount > 0"`
     - `alert_email`: `"default@example.com"`
     - `cron_schedule`: `"*/5 * * * *"`

### Example Behavior:
- If any of the values are missing in the YAML file or are empty, Terraform will use the default values specified within the `can()` checks, and the resource creation will proceed without failure.

### How to Apply:
1. Set the environment and business variables as required.
2. Run `terraform apply`, and missing or empty parameters in the YAML file will no longer cause Terraform to fail.

This approach ensures your Terraform configuration is robust and won’t fail due to missing or incomplete parameters.

Create multiple yaml input files for finance, marketing and engineering. Use module to reduce the repetition in the code.

To avoid repetition in your Terraform code when creating alerts for different business units (finance, marketing, and engineering) using separate YAML input files, we can leverage **Terraform modules**. This allows us to reuse code and make it flexible to handle different input configurations.

Here’s how you can implement this:

### Step 1: Create Multiple YAML Files

You will need to create separate YAML files for each business unit.

#### `finance_alerts.yaml`:
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "FinanceAlert1"
    search_query: "index=finance | stats count by account_id"
    alert_type: "always"
    alert_action: "email"
    alert_email: "finance@example.com"
    cron_schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
    alert_condition: "eventcount > 0"
```

#### `marketing_alerts.yaml`:
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "MarketingAlert1"
    search_query: "index=marketing | stats count by campaign_id"
    alert_type: "always"
    alert_action: "email"
    alert_email: "marketing@example.com"
    cron_schedule: "0 * * * *"
    alert_condition: "eventcount > 50"
```

#### `engineering_alerts.yaml`:
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "EngineeringAlert1"
    search_query: "index=engineering | stats count by service"
    alert_type: "always"
    alert_action: "email"
    alert_email: "engineering@example.com"
    cron_schedule: "*/10 * * * *"
    alert_condition: "eventcount > 10"
```

### Step 2: Create a Terraform Module

Create a module that handles the logic for creating the saved search alerts. This module will be reusable across multiple business units.

#### `modules/alerts/main.tf`:
```hcl
# Input variables for the YAML file path, environment, and business unit
variable "yaml_file" {
  type = string
}

variable "environment" {
  type = string
}

variable "business" {
  type = string
}

# Read the YAML file and decode it into a map
locals {
  alert_configs = yamldecode(file(var.yaml_file)).alerts
}

# Use a foreach loop to create multiple saved searches based on the YAML file input
resource "splunk_saved_searches" "alerts" {
  # Only create the alert if the environment is prod and business matches
  for_each = { for alert in local.alert_configs : alert.name => alert if var.environment == "prod" && var.business == each.value.name }

  name            = each.value.name
  search          = can(each.value.search_query) ? each.value.search_query : "index=_internal | stats count by sourcetype"  # Default search query
  alert_type      = can(each.value.alert_type) ? each.value.alert_type : "always"  # Default to always alert
  alert_actions   = can(each.value.alert_action) ? [each.value.alert_action] : ["email"]  # Default alert action
  alert_condition = can(each.value.alert_condition) ? each.value.alert_condition : "eventcount > 0"  # Default condition

  # Alert action settings
  action.email.to = can(each.value.alert_email) ? each.value.alert_email : "default@example.com"  # Default email

  # Define the schedule for the search to run
  cron_schedule = can(each.value.cron_schedule) ? each.value.cron_schedule : "*/5 * * * *"  # Default schedule

  # Additional options
  is_scheduled = true
  actions      = [each.value.alert_action]
}

output "splunk_alerts" {
  value = splunk_saved_searches.alerts
}
```

### Step 3: Use the Module in Your Root Configuration

You can now call the module for each business unit and provide the corresponding YAML file and other input variables.

#### `main.tf`:

```hcl
provider "splunk" {
  url      = "https://<SPLUNK_HOST>:8089"
  username = var.splunk_username
  password = var.splunk_password
}

# Input variables for the environment
variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Environment (dev or prod)"
}

variable "splunk_username" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_password" {
  type = string
}

# Use the module for Finance alerts
module "finance_alerts" {
  source      = "./modules/alerts"
  yaml_file   = "${path.module}/finance_alerts.yaml"
  environment = var.environment
  business    = "finance"
}

# Use the module for Marketing alerts
module "marketing_alerts" {
  source      = "./modules/alerts"
  yaml_file   = "${path.module}/marketing_alerts.yaml"
  environment = var.environment
  business    = "marketing"
}

# Use the module for Engineering alerts
module "engineering_alerts" {
  source      = "./modules/alerts"
  yaml_file   = "${path.module}/engineering_alerts.yaml"
  environment = var.environment
  business    = "engineering"
}
```

### Step 4: How to Apply

When applying the configuration, you can specify the environment and run the alerts creation for each business unit:

```bash
terraform apply -var="environment=prod" -var="splunk_username=<your_splunk_user>" -var="splunk_password=<your_splunk_password>"
```

### Key Points:
- **Module Reusability**: The `alerts` module is reused for each business unit, reducing redundancy.
- **Separate YAML Files**: Each business unit has its own YAML file to define its specific alerts.
- **Conditional Logic**: Alerts are only created when the `environment` is `prod` and the correct `business` is specified.
- **`can()` Function**: Ensures that missing or empty parameters do not cause failures.

This modular approach is scalable and reduces code repetition when creating alerts for multiple business units.

Please modify the code so that for provider "splunk" url, it has variable parameter for the endpoint name matching the business name, for example,  https://finance.splunk.company.com:8089 or https://marketing.splunk.company.com:8089.

To adjust the code so that the `provider "splunk"` dynamically uses a URL based on the business name (e.g., `https://finance.splunk.company.com:8089` or `https://marketing.splunk.company.com:8089`), we can use string interpolation and the `business` variable to construct the endpoint for the Splunk provider URL. This way, the provider URL will adapt to each business unit’s specific endpoint.

Here’s how you can modify the code:

### Step 1: Modify the Provider in the Module

In the `modules/alerts/main.tf` file, you can adjust the `provider "splunk"` block to use the `business` variable to dynamically build the URL:

#### `modules/alerts/main.tf`:

```hcl
# Provider using dynamic URL based on business name
provider "splunk" {
  url      = "https://${var.business}.splunk.company.com:8089"
  username = var.splunk_username
  password = var.splunk_password
}

# Input variables for the YAML file path, environment, business unit, and credentials
variable "yaml_file" {
  type = string
}

variable "environment" {
  type = string
}

variable "business" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_username" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_password" {
  type = string
}

# Read the YAML file and decode it into a map
locals {
  alert_configs = yamldecode(file(var.yaml_file)).alerts
}

# Use a foreach loop to create multiple saved searches based on the YAML file input
resource "splunk_saved_searches" "alerts" {
  # Only create the alert if the environment is prod and business matches
  for_each = { for alert in local.alert_configs : alert.name => alert if var.environment == "prod" && var.business == each.value.name }

  name            = each.value.name
  search          = can(each.value.search_query) ? each.value.search_query : "index=_internal | stats count by sourcetype"  # Default search query
  alert_type      = can(each.value.alert_type) ? each.value.alert_type : "always"  # Default to always alert
  alert_actions   = can(each.value.alert_action) ? [each.value.alert_action] : ["email"]  # Default alert action
  alert_condition = can(each.value.alert_condition) ? each.value.alert_condition : "eventcount > 0"  # Default condition

  # Alert action settings
  action.email.to = can(each.value.alert_email) ? each.value.alert_email : "default@example.com"  # Default email

  # Define the schedule for the search to run
  cron_schedule = can(each.value.cron_schedule) ? each.value.cron_schedule : "*/5 * * * *"  # Default schedule

  # Additional options
  is_scheduled = true
  actions      = [each.value.alert_action]
}

output "splunk_alerts" {
  value = splunk_saved_searches.alerts
}
```

### Step 2: Adjust the Root Configuration

In the `main.tf` file, when invoking the module for each business unit, you will now pass the `splunk_username`, `splunk_password`, and the business-specific parameters for the URL to be constructed dynamically:

#### `main.tf`:

```hcl
variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Environment (dev or prod)"
}

variable "splunk_username" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_password" {
  type = string
}

# Use the module for Finance alerts
module "finance_alerts" {
  source      = "./modules/alerts"
  yaml_file   = "${path.module}/finance_alerts.yaml"
  environment = var.environment
  business    = "finance"
  splunk_username = var.splunk_username
  splunk_password = var.splunk_password
}

# Use the module for Marketing alerts
module "marketing_alerts" {
  source      = "./modules/alerts"
  yaml_file   = "${path.module}/marketing_alerts.yaml"
  environment = var.environment
  business    = "marketing"
  splunk_username = var.splunk_username
  splunk_password = var.splunk_password
}

# Use the module for Engineering alerts
module "engineering_alerts" {
  source      = "./modules/alerts"
  yaml_file   = "${path.module}/engineering_alerts.yaml"
  environment = var.environment
  business    = "engineering"
  splunk_username = var.splunk_username
  splunk_password = var.splunk_password
}
```

### Step 3: Explanation of the Changes
- **Dynamic URL in Provider**: The `url` attribute in the `provider "splunk"` block is dynamically generated using `"https://${var.business}.splunk.company.com:8089"`, so the URL will automatically change based on the business unit (e.g., `finance`, `marketing`, `engineering`).
- **Business-Specific Credentials**: The `splunk_username` and `splunk_password` are passed as variables to the module, allowing each business unit to use the correct credentials when connecting to the Splunk instance.
- **Module Reusability**: The module is reused for finance, marketing, and engineering by specifying different YAML files and passing the business name dynamically.

### Step 4: How to Apply

You can now run the following command, and the Splunk provider will use the correct URL based on the business unit specified:

```bash
terraform apply -var="environment=prod" -var="splunk_username=<your_splunk_user>" -var="splunk_password=<your_splunk_password>"
```

This setup is now flexible, and each module invocation will dynamically use the appropriate Splunk URL based on the `business` variable.

modify the code so that the business unit name is a map, so that the business name can be dynamically added for growth.

To make the business unit names more dynamic and scalable by using a map, we can define a map variable for the business units and their corresponding Splunk URLs. This approach will allow you to easily add new business units without modifying the main logic.

Here’s how you can modify the code:

### Step 1: Define the Business Unit Map

In your root module (`main.tf`), define a variable that is a map of business unit names to their corresponding Splunk URLs. This will allow you to easily add new business units.

#### `main.tf`:

```hcl
# Variable for environment
variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Environment (dev or prod)"
}

# Variable for Splunk username
variable "splunk_username" {
  type = string
}

# Variable for Splunk password
variable "splunk_password" {
  type = string
}

# Map for business units and their corresponding Splunk URLs
variable "business_units" {
  description = "Map of business units to their Splunk endpoints"
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    finance    = "https://finance.splunk.company.com:8089"
    marketing  = "https://marketing.splunk.company.com:8089"
    engineering = "https://engineering.splunk.company.com:8089"
  }
}

# Use the module for Finance alerts
module "finance_alerts" {
  source      = "./modules/alerts"
  yaml_file   = "${path.module}/finance_alerts.yaml"
  environment = var.environment
  business    = "finance"
  splunk_url  = var.business_units["finance"]
  splunk_username = var.splunk_username
  splunk_password = var.splunk_password
}

# Use the module for Marketing alerts
module "marketing_alerts" {
  source      = "./modules/alerts"
  yaml_file   = "${path.module}/marketing_alerts.yaml"
  environment = var.environment
  business    = "marketing"
  splunk_url  = var.business_units["marketing"]
  splunk_username = var.splunk_username
  splunk_password = var.splunk_password
}

# Use the module for Engineering alerts
module "engineering_alerts" {
  source      = "./modules/alerts"
  yaml_file   = "${path.module}/engineering_alerts.yaml"
  environment = var.environment
  business    = "engineering"
  splunk_url  = var.business_units["engineering"]
  splunk_username = var.splunk_username
  splunk_password = var.splunk_password
}
```

### Step 2: Modify the Module to Accept a Splunk URL

In your module (`modules/alerts/main.tf`), modify the provider to accept the `splunk_url` as a variable. This makes the module more dynamic and able to handle different Splunk endpoints for different business units.

#### `modules/alerts/main.tf`:

```hcl
# Provider using dynamic URL based on the passed business unit
provider "splunk" {
  url      = var.splunk_url
  username = var.splunk_username
  password = var.splunk_password
}

# Input variables for the YAML file path, environment, business unit, Splunk URL, and credentials
variable "yaml_file" {
  type = string
}

variable "environment" {
  type = string
}

variable "business" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_url" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_username" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_password" {
  type = string
}

# Read the YAML file and decode it into a map
locals {
  alert_configs = yamldecode(file(var.yaml_file)).alerts
}

# Use a foreach loop to create multiple saved searches based on the YAML file input
resource "splunk_saved_searches" "alerts" {
  # Only create the alert if the environment is prod and business matches
  for_each = { for alert in local.alert_configs : alert.name => alert if var.environment == "prod" && var.business == each.value.name }

  name            = each.value.name
  search          = can(each.value.search_query) ? each.value.search_query : "index=_internal | stats count by sourcetype"  # Default search query
  alert_type      = can(each.value.alert_type) ? each.value.alert_type : "always"  # Default to always alert
  alert_actions   = can(each.value.alert_action) ? [each.value.alert_action] : ["email"]  # Default alert action
  alert_condition = can(each.value.alert_condition) ? each.value.alert_condition : "eventcount > 0"  # Default condition

  # Alert action settings
  action.email.to = can(each.value.alert_email) ? each.value.alert_email : "default@example.com"  # Default email

  # Define the schedule for the search to run
  cron_schedule = can(each.value.cron_schedule) ? each.value.cron_schedule : "*/5 * * * *"  # Default schedule

  # Additional options
  is_scheduled = true
  actions      = [each.value.alert_action]
}

output "splunk_alerts" {
  value = splunk_saved_searches.alerts
}
```

### Step 3: Adding a New Business Unit

To add a new business unit (e.g., `sales`), simply update the `business_units` map in the root configuration (`main.tf`):

```hcl
variable "business_units" {
  description = "Map of business units to their Splunk endpoints"
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    finance    = "https://finance.splunk.company.com:8089"
    marketing  = "https://marketing.splunk.company.com:8089"
    engineering = "https://engineering.splunk.company.com:8089"
    sales      = "https://sales.splunk.company.com:8089"  # New business unit
  }
}
```

And call the module for the `sales` unit:

```hcl
# Use the module for Sales alerts
module "sales_alerts" {
  source      = "./modules/alerts"
  yaml_file   = "${path.module}/sales_alerts.yaml"
  environment = var.environment
  business    = "sales"
  splunk_url  = var.business_units["sales"]
  splunk_username = var.splunk_username
  splunk_password = var.splunk_password
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`business_units` Map**: This map holds the business unit names as keys and the corresponding Splunk URLs as values. You can dynamically grow this list without changing the logic inside the module or provider setup.
- **Dynamic `splunk_url`**: The `splunk_url` is dynamically passed to the provider based on the business unit selected.
- **Scalable Solution**: Adding new business units (like `sales` or others) only requires updating the `business_units` map and adding a new module invocation.

### Step 4: How to Apply

Run the following command to apply the configuration:

```bash
terraform apply -var="environment=prod" -var="splunk_username=<your_splunk_user>" -var="splunk_password=<your_splunk_password>"
```

This approach is scalable and allows you to easily manage multiple business units by simply updating the map with new units and corresponding URLs.

## The business unit is a subdirectory inside the module, and the input yaml file for alert parameter is inside a business unit subdirectory.

To organize the YAML input files into subdirectories for each business unit inside the Terraform module, we can adjust the structure of the module and the main configuration. Each business unit will have its own subdirectory inside the module directory, and the alert parameters will be placed inside the respective subdirectory as a YAML file.

Here’s how to modify the code:

### Directory Structure

First, create a directory structure where each business unit (e.g., `finance`, `marketing`, `engineering`) has its own subdirectory inside the `modules/alerts` module, and the YAML files for each business unit’s alert configuration are stored in the respective subdirectory.

```
terraform/
├── main.tf
├── modules/
│   └── alerts/
│       ├── finance/
│       │   └── finance_alerts.yaml
│       ├── marketing/
│       │   └── marketing_alerts.yaml
│       └── engineering/
│           └── engineering_alerts.yaml
```

### Step 1: Modify the Module to Support Subdirectories

In the `modules/alerts/main.tf` file, adjust the code to handle the input YAML files from a subdirectory based on the business unit:

#### `modules/alerts/main.tf`:

```hcl
# Provider using dynamic URL based on the passed business unit
provider "splunk" {
  url      = var.splunk_url
  username = var.splunk_username
  password = var.splunk_password
}

# Input variables for the environment, business unit, YAML path, and credentials
variable "business_unit" {
  type = string
}

variable "environment" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_url" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_username" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_password" {
  type = string
}

# Path to the YAML file for the specific business unit
variable "yaml_file" {
  type = string
  description = "Path to the YAML file containing alert configurations"
}

# Read the YAML file from the business unit subdirectory
locals {
  alert_configs = yamldecode(file("${path.module}/${var.business_unit}/${var.yaml_file}")).alerts
}

# Create alerts only for prod environment and matching business unit
resource "splunk_saved_searches" "alerts" {
  for_each = { for alert in local.alert_configs : alert.name => alert if var.environment == "prod" && var.business_unit == each.value.name }

  name            = each.value.name
  search          = can(each.value.search_query) ? each.value.search_query : "index=_internal | stats count by sourcetype"  # Default search query
  alert_type      = can(each.value.alert_type) ? each.value.alert_type : "always"  # Default to always alert
  alert_actions   = can(each.value.alert_action) ? [each.value.alert_action] : ["email"]  # Default alert action
  alert_condition = can(each.value.alert_condition) ? each.value.alert_condition : "eventcount > 0"  # Default condition

  # Alert action settings
  action.email.to = can(each.value.alert_email) ? each.value.alert_email : "default@example.com"  # Default email

  # Define the schedule for the search to run
  cron_schedule = can(each.value.cron_schedule) ? each.value.cron_schedule : "*/5 * * * *"  # Default schedule

  # Additional options
  is_scheduled = true
  actions      = [each.value.alert_action]
}

output "splunk_alerts" {
  value = splunk_saved_searches.alerts
}
```

### Step 2: Adjust the Root Configuration (`main.tf`)

In the root configuration (`main.tf`), you will invoke the module for each business unit and specify the path to the respective YAML file inside the subdirectory. 

#### `main.tf`:

```hcl
# Variable for environment
variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Environment (dev or prod)"
}

# Variable for Splunk username
variable "splunk_username" {
  type = string
}

# Variable for Splunk password
variable "splunk_password" {
  type = string
}

# Map for business units and their corresponding Splunk URLs
variable "business_units" {
  description = "Map of business units to their Splunk endpoints"
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    finance     = "https://finance.splunk.company.com:8089"
    marketing   = "https://marketing.splunk.company.com:8089"
    engineering = "https://engineering.splunk.company.com:8089"
  }
}

# Finance alerts
module "finance_alerts" {
  source        = "./modules/alerts"
  business_unit = "finance"
  yaml_file     = "finance_alerts.yaml"
  environment   = var.environment
  splunk_url    = var.business_units["finance"]
  splunk_username = var.splunk_username
  splunk_password = var.splunk_password
}

# Marketing alerts
module "marketing_alerts" {
  source        = "./modules/alerts"
  business_unit = "marketing"
  yaml_file     = "marketing_alerts.yaml"
  environment   = var.environment
  splunk_url    = var.business_units["marketing"]
  splunk_username = var.splunk_username
  splunk_password = var.splunk_password
}

# Engineering alerts
module "engineering_alerts" {
  source        = "./modules/alerts"
  business_unit = "engineering"
  yaml_file     = "engineering_alerts.yaml"
  environment   = var.environment
  splunk_url    = var.business_units["engineering"]
  splunk_username = var.splunk_username
  splunk_password = var.splunk_password
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Directory Structure**: Each business unit now has its own subdirectory inside the `modules/alerts` directory, and the corresponding YAML file is placed inside that subdirectory.
   
2. **Dynamic YAML File Loading**: The path to the YAML file is built dynamically inside the module using the `business_unit` variable. The YAML file path is passed from the root module based on the business unit's subdirectory.

3. **Module Reusability**: Each module invocation for different business units (finance, marketing, engineering) uses the same module but with different subdirectory paths and YAML files, which makes the setup modular and scalable.

4. **Business Unit Flexibility**: The use of subdirectories and the `business_unit` variable allows you to easily add new business units by creating a new subdirectory and YAML file for that business unit, without changing the module logic.

### How to Apply:
You can apply the configuration by running the following command:

```bash
terraform apply -var="environment=prod" -var="splunk_username=<your_splunk_user>" -var="splunk_password=<your_splunk_password>"
```

This solution organizes the YAML files and module inputs in a scalable way, making it easy to maintain and add new business units in the future.

## Reduce down the blocks repetition in root main.tf above by adding for loop and make business unit name dynamic. 

To reduce the repetition in your `main.tf` and dynamically loop over the business units, you can use a `for_each` loop to iterate over the business units. Instead of repeating blocks for each business unit (finance, marketing, engineering), we can refactor the configuration to loop through a map that includes the business unit name and corresponding YAML file.

Here’s how to achieve this using Terraform's `for_each`:

### Refactored Root Configuration (`main.tf`):

```hcl
# Variable for environment
variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Environment (dev or prod)"
}

# Variable for Splunk username
variable "splunk_username" {
  type = string
}

# Variable for Splunk password
variable "splunk_password" {
  type = string
}

# Map for business units and their corresponding YAML file paths and Splunk URLs
variable "business_units" {
  description = "Map of business units to their Splunk endpoints and YAML files"
  type = map(object({
    splunk_url = string
    yaml_file  = string
  }))
  default = {
    finance = {
      splunk_url = "https://finance.splunk.company.com:8089"
      yaml_file  = "finance/finance_alerts.yaml"
    }
    marketing = {
      splunk_url = "https://marketing.splunk.company.com:8089"
      yaml_file  = "marketing/marketing_alerts.yaml"
    }
    engineering = {
      splunk_url = "https://engineering.splunk.company.com:8089"
      yaml_file  = "engineering/engineering_alerts.yaml"
    }
  }
}

# Iterate over each business unit
module "alerts" {
  for_each       = var.business_units

  source         = "./modules/alerts"
  business_unit  = each.key
  yaml_file      = each.value.yaml_file
  environment    = var.environment
  splunk_url     = each.value.splunk_url
  splunk_username = var.splunk_username
  splunk_password = var.splunk_password
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **`business_units` Variable**: This is a map where each key is a business unit (like `finance`, `marketing`, and `engineering`), and the value is an object that contains the `splunk_url` and the path to the respective `yaml_file`.
   
2. **`for_each` Loop in the Module**: The `module "alerts"` block uses `for_each = var.business_units`, which will dynamically iterate over each business unit in the `business_units` map. It creates a separate instance of the module for each business unit, passing the correct values for `splunk_url` and `yaml_file`.

3. **Dynamic Inputs**: The `each.key` gives the business unit name (like `finance`, `marketing`, or `engineering`), and `each.value.yaml_file` and `each.value.splunk_url` extract the specific YAML file path and Splunk URL for each business unit.

### How to Apply:
You can run Terraform as usual with the following command:

```bash
terraform apply -var="environment=prod" -var="splunk_username=<your_splunk_user>" -var="splunk_password=<your_splunk_password>"
```

This configuration is now more scalable and eliminates the need for repetitive blocks in the root `main.tf`. Adding a new business unit only requires updating the `business_units` map.

modify the code so that finance, marketing, engineering is a dynamic variable.

To make the business unit names (`finance`, `marketing`, `engineering`, etc.) fully dynamic through a variable, you can modify the `business_units` variable to accept a list of business unit names. Then, you can dynamically construct the `splunk_url` and `yaml_file` paths based on these business unit names.

### Updated Root Configuration (`main.tf`):

```hcl
# Variable for environment
variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Environment (dev or prod)"
}

# Variable for Splunk username
variable "splunk_username" {
  type = string
}

# Variable for Splunk password
variable "splunk_password" {
  type = string
}

# List of business units (dynamically defined)
variable "business_units" {
  description = "List of business units"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["finance", "marketing", "engineering"]
}

# Map for Splunk URL template and YAML file path template
locals {
  business_unit_data = { for unit in var.business_units : 
    unit => {
      splunk_url = "https://${unit}.splunk.company.com:8089"
      yaml_file  = "${unit}/${unit}_alerts.yaml"
    }
  }
}

# Iterate over each business unit using the dynamic map constructed in locals
module "alerts" {
  for_each       = local.business_unit_data

  source         = "./modules/alerts"
  business_unit  = each.key
  yaml_file      = each.value.yaml_file
  environment    = var.environment
  splunk_url     = each.value.splunk_url
  splunk_username = var.splunk_username
  splunk_password = var.splunk_password
}
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Dynamic List of Business Units**: 
   - The `business_units` variable is now a list of strings that dynamically defines the business units. You can modify this list by simply passing in different business units during runtime or by defining them in `terraform.tfvars`.
   
2. **Dynamic Construction in `locals`**:
   - The `local.business_unit_data` block creates a map for each business unit. It constructs both the `splunk_url` and the path to the corresponding `yaml_file` based on the business unit name.
   - The `splunk_url` is generated using the business unit name (`unit`) in the format `https://${unit}.splunk.company.com:8089`.
   - Similarly, the `yaml_file` is dynamically created as `/${unit}/${unit}_alerts.yaml`.

3. **Dynamic Module Invocation**:
   - The `for_each` loop in the module dynamically creates a module instance for each business unit, using the `local.business_unit_data` map to pull in the correct `splunk_url` and `yaml_file` for each unit.

### How to Apply:

You can run this Terraform configuration as usual, dynamically controlling the business units by modifying the `business_units` list.

For example, to include a new business unit (`sales`), you can do:

```hcl
variable "business_units" {
  default = ["finance", "marketing", "engineering", "sales"]
}
```

Then apply the configuration:

```bash
terraform apply -var="environment=prod" -var="splunk_username=<your_splunk_user>" -var="splunk_password=<your_splunk_password>"
```

This approach dynamically scales to new business units by simply modifying the `business_units` list, without requiring additional hardcoded configurations.

modify the code so that 2 or more alert action can be accepted, e.g email,pagerduty or email,slack,pagerduty.

To modify the configuration so that 2 or more alert actions (e.g., `email`, `pagerduty`, `slack`) can be accepted, we can update the input to take a list of alert actions and modify the module to handle multiple actions.

Here's how to do it:

### Step 1: Update the `main.tf` to Handle Multiple Alert Actions

#### Updated Root Configuration (`main.tf`):

```hcl
# Variable for environment
variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Environment (dev or prod)"
}

# Variable for Splunk username
variable "splunk_username" {
  type = string
}

# Variable for Splunk password
variable "splunk_password" {
  type = string
}

# List of business units (dynamically defined)
variable "business_units" {
  description = "List of business units"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["finance", "marketing", "engineering"]
}

# Variable for default alert actions (multiple actions supported)
variable "alert_actions" {
  description = "List of alert actions (e.g., email, pagerduty, slack)"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["email", "pagerduty"]  # You can modify this as needed
}

# Map for Splunk URL template and YAML file path template
locals {
  business_unit_data = { for unit in var.business_units : 
    unit => {
      splunk_url = "https://${unit}.splunk.company.com:8089"
      yaml_file  = "${unit}/${unit}_alerts.yaml"
    }
  }
}

# Iterate over each business unit using the dynamic map constructed in locals
module "alerts" {
  for_each       = local.business_unit_data

  source         = "./modules/alerts"
  business_unit  = each.key
  yaml_file      = each.value.yaml_file
  environment    = var.environment
  splunk_url     = each.value.splunk_url
  splunk_username = var.splunk_username
  splunk_password = var.splunk_password
  alert_actions  = var.alert_actions  # Pass alert actions to the module
}
```

### Step 2: Modify the Module to Accept Multiple Alert Actions

In the `modules/alerts/main.tf` file, we will modify the `alert_actions` input to handle multiple alert actions and pass them to the `splunk_saved_searches` resource.

#### Updated `modules/alerts/main.tf`:

```hcl
# Provider using dynamic URL based on the passed business unit
provider "splunk" {
  url      = var.splunk_url
  username = var.splunk_username
  password = var.splunk_password
}

# Input variables for the environment, business unit, YAML path, alert actions, and credentials
variable "business_unit" {
  type = string
}

variable "environment" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_url" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_username" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_password" {
  type = string
}

variable "yaml_file" {
  type = string
}

# Accept multiple alert actions (e.g., email, pagerduty, slack)
variable "alert_actions" {
  type = list(string)
}

# Read the YAML file from the business unit subdirectory
locals {
  alert_configs = yamldecode(file("${path.module}/${var.business_unit}/${var.yaml_file}")).alerts
}

# Create alerts only for prod environment and matching business unit
resource "splunk_saved_searches" "alerts" {
  for_each = { for alert in local.alert_configs : alert.name => alert if var.environment == "prod" && var.business_unit == each.value.name }

  name            = each.value.name
  search          = can(each.value.search_query) ? each.value.search_query : "index=_internal | stats count by sourcetype"  # Default search query
  alert_type      = can(each.value.alert_type) ? each.value.alert_type : "always"  # Default to always alert
  alert_actions   = var.alert_actions  # Use multiple alert actions from input
  alert_condition = can(each.value.alert_condition) ? each.value.alert_condition : "eventcount > 0"  # Default condition

  # Define the alert actions based on the alert type
  action.email.to = can(each.value.alert_email) ? each.value.alert_email : "default@example.com"  # Default email

  # Define the schedule for the search to run
  cron_schedule = can(each.value.cron_schedule) ? each.value.cron_schedule : "*/5 * * * *"  # Default schedule

  # Additional options
  is_scheduled = true
}

output "splunk_alerts" {
  value = splunk_saved_searches.alerts
}
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Multiple Alert Actions**:
   - In the root `main.tf`, the `alert_actions` variable is now a list of strings (e.g., `["email", "pagerduty", "slack"]`).
   - The module accepts this list and applies it to the `splunk_saved_searches` resource, which supports multiple alert actions.

2. **Dynamic Alert Actions**:
   - Each business unit will now accept multiple alert actions (e.g., `email`, `pagerduty`, `slack`), and you can pass them dynamically through the `alert_actions` variable.
   
3. **No Hardcoding of Actions**:
   - This setup allows flexibility in specifying the alert actions at the time of deployment, reducing the need to modify the module or root configuration when adding or changing alert actions.

### How to Apply:

You can now run the following command, and it will handle multiple alert actions:

```bash
terraform apply -var="environment=prod" -var="splunk_username=<your_splunk_user>" -var="splunk_password=<your_splunk_password>" -var="alert_actions=['email','pagerduty','slack']"
```

This approach allows you to manage multiple alert actions dynamically for each business unit.

change back the alert_actions as part of the  input parameter in the yaml file.

To revert to using `alert_actions` as part of the input parameters defined in the YAML file for each business unit, we can modify the Terraform code to dynamically read the alert actions from the YAML file instead of passing them as a separate variable. Here's how you can adjust the setup:

### Step 1: Update the YAML Files

Each business unit YAML file will need an `alert_actions` field, which can now accept multiple actions.

#### `finance_alerts.yaml`:

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "FinanceAlert1"
    search_query: "index=finance | stats count by account_id"
    alert_type: "always"
    alert_actions: ["email", "pagerduty"]
    alert_email: "finance@example.com"
    cron_schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
    alert_condition: "eventcount > 0"
```

#### `marketing_alerts.yaml`:

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "MarketingAlert1"
    search_query: "index=marketing | stats count by campaign_id"
    alert_type: "always"
    alert_actions: ["email", "slack"]
    alert_email: "marketing@example.com"
    cron_schedule: "*/10 * * * *"
    alert_condition: "eventcount > 50"
```

### Step 2: Modify the Module to Read `alert_actions` from YAML

Now, update the module to read the `alert_actions` directly from the YAML file.

#### `modules/alerts/main.tf`:

```hcl
# Provider using dynamic URL based on the passed business unit
provider "splunk" {
  url      = var.splunk_url
  username = var.splunk_username
  password = var.splunk_password
}

# Input variables for the environment, business unit, YAML path, and credentials
variable "business_unit" {
  type = string
}

variable "environment" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_url" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_username" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_password" {
  type = string
}

variable "yaml_file" {
  type = string
}

# Read the YAML file from the business unit subdirectory
locals {
  alert_configs = yamldecode(file("${path.module}/${var.business_unit}/${var.yaml_file}")).alerts
}

# Create alerts only for prod environment and matching business unit
resource "splunk_saved_searches" "alerts" {
  for_each = { for alert in local.alert_configs : alert.name => alert if var.environment == "prod" && var.business_unit == each.value.name }

  name            = each.value.name
  search          = can(each.value.search_query) ? each.value.search_query : "index=_internal | stats count by sourcetype"  # Default search query
  alert_type      = can(each.value.alert_type) ? each.value.alert_type : "always"  # Default to always alert
  alert_actions   = can(each.value.alert_actions) ? each.value.alert_actions : ["email"]  # Use multiple alert actions from YAML, default to email
  alert_condition = can(each.value.alert_condition) ? each.value.alert_condition : "eventcount > 0"  # Default condition

  # Define the alert actions based on the alert type
  action.email.to = can(each.value.alert_email) ? each.value.alert_email : "default@example.com"  # Default email

  # Define the schedule for the search to run
  cron_schedule = can(each.value.cron_schedule) ? each.value.cron_schedule : "*/5 * * * *"  # Default schedule

  # Additional options
  is_scheduled = true
}

output "splunk_alerts" {
  value = splunk_saved_searches.alerts
}
```

### Key Changes:

1. **`alert_actions` in YAML**: 
   - The `alert_actions` field is now defined in each business unit's YAML file. It can accept multiple actions such as `["email", "pagerduty", "slack"]`.
   
2. **Module Reading `alert_actions`**:
   - The `alert_actions` field is dynamically read from the YAML file using `each.value.alert_actions`.
   - If the `alert_actions` field is not present in the YAML file, it defaults to `["email"]`.

3. **Dynamic Alert Actions**:
   - Each business unit can specify its own set of alert actions through the YAML configuration, providing flexibility for different configurations across business units.

### Step 3: How to Apply

You can now run the following command, and it will dynamically use the `alert_actions` from the YAML files for each business unit:

```bash
terraform apply -var="environment=prod" -var="splunk_username=<your_splunk_user>" -var="splunk_password=<your_splunk_password>"
```

This approach makes the configuration more flexible by allowing the specification of multiple alert actions directly in the YAML file, tailored to each business unit. You can easily add or modify alert actions in the YAML files without changing the Terraform code.

modify the logic in the yaml input file , if the alert action contains slack, add the requirement for slack webhook as additional input parameter

To modify the logic so that if the `alert_actions` contains `slack`, the YAML file will require an additional input parameter for the Slack webhook, you can add conditional logic in Terraform to check for the presence of `slack` in the `alert_actions` list. If `slack` is present, the Terraform module will expect a `slack_webhook` parameter in the YAML file.

Here’s how to implement this:

### Step 1: Update the YAML Files

The YAML file will now include the `slack_webhook` parameter only if `slack` is part of the `alert_actions`.

#### `finance_alerts.yaml` (No Slack):

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "FinanceAlert1"
    search_query: "index=finance | stats count by account_id"
    alert_type: "always"
    alert_actions: ["email", "pagerduty"]
    alert_email: "finance@example.com"
    cron_schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
    alert_condition: "eventcount > 0"
```

#### `marketing_alerts.yaml` (With Slack):

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "MarketingAlert1"
    search_query: "index=marketing | stats count by campaign_id"
    alert_type: "always"
    alert_actions: ["email", "slack"]
    alert_email: "marketing@example.com"
    slack_webhook: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    cron_schedule: "*/10 * * * *"
    alert_condition: "eventcount > 50"
```

### Step 2: Modify the Module to Handle Slack Webhook

Now, update the Terraform module to handle the `slack_webhook` when `slack` is part of the `alert_actions`.

#### `modules/alerts/main.tf`:

```hcl
# Provider using dynamic URL based on the passed business unit
provider "splunk" {
  url      = var.splunk_url
  username = var.splunk_username
  password = var.splunk_password
}

# Input variables for the environment, business unit, YAML path, and credentials
variable "business_unit" {
  type = string
}

variable "environment" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_url" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_username" {
  type = string
}

variable "splunk_password" {
  type = string
}

variable "yaml_file" {
  type = string
}

# Read the YAML file from the business unit subdirectory
locals {
  alert_configs = yamldecode(file("${path.module}/${var.business_unit}/${var.yaml_file}")).alerts
}

# Create alerts only for prod environment and matching business unit
resource "splunk_saved_searches" "alerts" {
  for_each = { for alert in local.alert_configs : alert.name => alert if var.environment == "prod" && var.business_unit == each.value.name }

  name            = each.value.name
  search          = can(each.value.search_query) ? each.value.search_query : "index=_internal | stats count by sourcetype"  # Default search query
  alert_type      = can(each.value.alert_type) ? each.value.alert_type : "always"  # Default to always alert
  alert_actions   = can(each.value.alert_actions) ? each.value.alert_actions : ["email"]  # Use multiple alert actions from YAML, default to email
  alert_condition = can(each.value.alert_condition) ? each.value.alert_condition : "eventcount > 0"  # Default condition

  # Define the alert actions based on the alert type
  action.email.to = can(each.value.alert_email) ? each.value.alert_email : "default@example.com"  # Default email

  # Check if slack is part of alert actions, then add slack webhook
  dynamic "action.slack" {
    for_each = contains(each.value.alert_actions, "slack") ? [each.value] : []
    content {
      webhook = can(each.value.slack_webhook) ? each.value.slack_webhook : "https://default-webhook-url"  # Default slack webhook
    }
  }

  # Define the schedule for the search to run
  cron_schedule = can(each.value.cron_schedule) ? each.value.cron_schedule : "*/5 * * * *"  # Default schedule

  # Additional options
  is_scheduled = true
}

output "splunk_alerts" {
  value = splunk_saved_searches.alerts
}
```

### Key Changes:

1. **`alert_actions` in YAML**: 
   - The `alert_actions` field can include multiple actions, and if `slack` is one of them, the YAML file requires a `slack_webhook` field.
   
2. **Conditional Slack Webhook Logic**:
   - The `dynamic` block is used to conditionally create the `action.slack` block if `slack` is found in the `alert_actions` list.
   - The `webhook` parameter is set to the value of `slack_webhook` from the YAML file. If it's missing, a default value is provided to avoid failure.

3. **Robust Logic**:
   - If `slack` is not part of the `alert_actions`, the Slack webhook is ignored.
   - If `slack` is present but the `slack_webhook` is missing, the logic assigns a default webhook to prevent errors.

### Step 3: How to Apply

Run the following command as usual, and the configuration will dynamically include or exclude the Slack webhook based on the `alert_actions` in the YAML files:

```bash
terraform apply -var="environment=prod" -var="splunk_username=<your_splunk_user>" -var="splunk_password=<your_splunk_password>"
```

### Example Behavior:

- If `alert_actions` contains `slack`, the Slack webhook will be added.
- If `alert_actions` doesn't contain `slack`, no Slack-related configuration will be applied.
- The configuration is flexible to allow different business units to have unique alert configurations, including the option to add or remove `slack` alerts easily.

This setup ensures that the `slack_webhook` is only required if the `alert_actions` includes `slack`, providing flexibility and reducing the risk of errors from missing parameters.

Give an example for "flatten" function based on the code above.

The `flatten` function in Terraform can be used to take a nested list and flatten it into a single list. In the context of the code above, you could use `flatten` if you had multiple alert actions or configurations across different business units and wanted to create a single, flat list of actions or webhooks.

Let me give you an example of how `flatten` could be used in the above code:

### Scenario:
Each business unit's YAML file contains a list of `alert_actions`. Some business units have multiple actions, while others have a single action or none. You want to combine all alert actions from all business units into a single list to ensure that no action is missed across the entire infrastructure.

### Step 1: Add Multiple `alert_actions` to YAML Files

#### `finance_alerts.yaml`:

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "FinanceAlert1"
    search_query: "index=finance | stats count by account_id"
    alert_type: "always"
    alert_actions: ["email", "pagerduty"]
    alert_email: "finance@example.com"
    cron_schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
    alert_condition: "eventcount > 0"
```

#### `marketing_alerts.yaml`:

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "MarketingAlert1"
    search_query: "index=marketing | stats count by campaign_id"
    alert_type: "always"
    alert_actions: ["email", "slack"]
    alert_email: "marketing@example.com"
    slack_webhook: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XYZ"
    cron_schedule: "*/10 * * * *"
    alert_condition: "eventcount > 50"
```

### Step 2: Flatten the Alert Actions

You want to extract all the `alert_actions` across different business units and flatten them into a single list.

```hcl
provider "splunk" {
  url      = var.splunk_url
  username = var.splunk_username
  password = var.splunk_password
}

variable "business_units" {
  type = list(string)
  default = ["finance", "marketing"]
}

# Read the YAML for each business unit
locals {
  alert_configs = [for unit in var.business_units : yamldecode(file("${path.module}/${unit}/${unit}_alerts.yaml")).alerts]

  # Extract all alert actions
  all_alert_actions = flatten([for config in local.alert_configs : [for alert in config : alert.alert_actions]])
}

# Flattened list of alert actions
output "all_alert_actions" {
  value = local.all_alert_actions
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **`alert_configs`**: We iterate over the `business_units` and decode each YAML file into a list of `alerts`. This results in a nested list of alerts across the different business units.

2. **`flatten()`**: The `flatten()` function takes the nested lists of `alert_actions` and combines them into a single flat list. Without `flatten()`, you would have a list of lists, but after flattening, you'll have a single list of all alert actions from all the business units.

### Example Output:

Given the above YAML configurations, the output would be:

```hcl
all_alert_actions = ["email", "pagerduty", "email", "slack"]
```

This flattened list now contains all the alert actions across both the `finance` and `marketing` business units, ensuring that no alert action is missed.

### Use Case:

You might want to use this `flatten()` function in real scenarios where you need to enforce common configurations or gather a summary of all actions across multiple business units and environments, making sure that the system handles all necessary alert actions consistently.

Pleae provide the most simple terraform configuration.

Here’s a simple Terraform configuration example that provisions an AWS EC2 instance. This configuration includes the provider declaration, a resource block, and basic outputs.

### Simple Terraform Configuration:

```hcl
# Specify the provider (in this case, AWS)
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Create an EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Amazon Linux 2 AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"               # EC2 instance type

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform Example Instance"    # Tag the instance with a name
  }
}

# Output the public IP of the EC2 instance
output "instance_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}
```

### Steps:
1. **Provider Block**: Specifies the AWS provider and region to use.
2. **Resource Block**: Defines an AWS EC2 instance with the `aws_instance` resource. You specify the AMI ID (Amazon Linux 2 in this case) and instance type (`t2.micro`).
3. **Output Block**: Displays the public IP of the EC2 instance after it's created.

### Usage:
1. Save this configuration in a file called `main.tf`.
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
3. Run `terraform apply` to create the EC2 instance.

This is a very basic configuration, but it demonstrates the key concepts of Terraform: providers, resources, and outputs.

Please configure lock file in mongodb and state file in s3

To configure a **state file in S3** and a **lock file in MongoDB** for Terraform, you can follow these steps. The S3 bucket will store the Terraform state file, and MongoDB will act as the backend for locking during Terraform operations.

### 1. **S3 Backend for State File**

First, configure Terraform to store the state file in an AWS S3 bucket. This is achieved by using the `backend "s3"` block in your configuration.

### 2. **MongoDB for Locking**

Since MongoDB isn't natively supported as a locking backend in Terraform, you can use a **DynamoDB table** for locking, which is a standard practice with S3 backends. If you absolutely need MongoDB, it would require custom scripting, but I will provide the standard DynamoDB approach as an alternative.

### Example Configuration for S3 and DynamoDB:

This example will store the state file in S3 and handle locking in DynamoDB, which is the standard solution for locking with an S3 backend.

#### Terraform Configuration (`main.tf`):

```hcl
# Define the S3 backend to store the state file and use DynamoDB for locking
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"  # Name of your S3 bucket
    key            = "terraform/state.tfstate"    # Path to the state file
    region         = "us-west-2"                  # AWS region for the S3 bucket
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"            # DynamoDB table for state locking
    encrypt        = true                         # Enable encryption for state file
  }
}

# AWS provider configuration
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Example resource: create an EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform Example Instance"
  }
}

# Output the public IP of the instance
output "instance_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **S3 Backend for State**:
   - The `backend "s3"` block configures Terraform to store its state in an S3 bucket.
   - The `bucket` is the name of the S3 bucket.
   - The `key` is the path within the S3 bucket where the state file will be stored.
   - The `region` is the AWS region where the S3 bucket is located.
   - The `dynamodb_table` is the DynamoDB table used for state locking, which helps to ensure only one Terraform operation is performed at a time.
   - The `encrypt = true` ensures that the state file is encrypted at rest in S3.

2. **DynamoDB for Locking**:
   - You can create a DynamoDB table (`terraform-locks`) that will be used to lock the state file during Terraform operations.
   - You only need a single partition key (`LockID`) with type `String` to handle the locking.

### 3. **Create the S3 Bucket and DynamoDB Table**

To ensure your S3 bucket and DynamoDB table exist before running Terraform, you can create them manually or using the AWS CLI.

#### Create S3 Bucket (AWS CLI):

```bash
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-terraform-state-bucket --region us-west-2
```

#### Create DynamoDB Table (AWS CLI):

```bash
aws dynamodb create-table \
    --table-name terraform-locks \
    --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S \
    --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH \
    --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5 \
    --region us-west-2
```

### Notes on Using MongoDB for Locking

- Terraform doesn’t natively support MongoDB as a backend for state locking. You would need custom scripts or an external service to implement MongoDB-based locking. If MongoDB is a requirement, a potential workaround is to develop custom code to handle the locking in MongoDB while using S3 for state storage.
- DynamoDB is the recommended solution for locking with S3 backends because it's fully supported by Terraform and handles concurrency and retries well.

### Summary:

- **State Storage**: Terraform state is stored in an S3 bucket.
- **State Locking**: A DynamoDB table is used to manage locks on the state file, preventing concurrent operations.
- **MongoDB Locking**: If MongoDB is required for locking, you would need a custom approach, but it's not natively supported by Terraform.

Would you like to explore custom MongoDB locking in more detail, or is this configuration suitable for your needs?

How does dynamodb state locking work for terraform?

Terraform uses **DynamoDB state locking** to ensure that only one Terraform execution (like `plan` or `apply`) is modifying the infrastructure at a time when using remote state stored in AWS S3. This helps prevent race conditions, which could otherwise occur if multiple users or automation systems tried to update the infrastructure concurrently.

### How DynamoDB State Locking Works:
1. **Lock Table Creation**: 
   - When using S3 as the backend for storing state, Terraform can be configured to use DynamoDB for state locking by specifying the `dynamodb_table` parameter in the backend configuration.
   - The DynamoDB table must have a primary key `LockID` (type `String`). This table is used exclusively for managing locks and can be created with minimal provisioned capacity.

2. **Lock Acquisition**:
   - When a Terraform operation is initiated, it attempts to acquire a lock by writing a unique item into the DynamoDB table. This item represents the current lock, which typically contains information such as:
     - The unique `LockID` (e.g., the state file's key path).
     - A `LeaseDuration` that specifies how long the lock is valid.
     - Other metadata like who holds the lock (user ID or machine).

3. **Terraform Operations**:
   - As long as the lock is held, no other Terraform process can modify the same state file. This prevents two processes from simultaneously applying changes or generating plans, which could lead to inconsistencies.

4. **Lock Release**:
   - Once the Terraform operation (e.g., `apply`) is complete, the lock is released by deleting the item from the DynamoDB table. This allows other processes to acquire the lock and start their operations.

5. **Handling Lock Contention**:
   - If another process tries to acquire the lock while it is held by a different Terraform execution, it will receive an error like `Error acquiring the state lock`. The process will continue retrying for a configurable duration until it either successfully acquires the lock or fails due to a timeout.

6. **Automatic Lock Expiry**:
   - The lock has a TTL (`LeaseDuration`) that determines how long the lock is valid. If the process holding the lock crashes or doesn't release it properly, the lock will automatically expire after the specified duration, allowing others to acquire it.

### Example DynamoDB Table:

When Terraform requests a lock, it inserts an entry like this into the DynamoDB table:

| LockID      | Info (metadata)                   |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| `terraform.tfstate` | `{"Operation": "apply", "Info": "User 123", "Started": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"}` |

Once the operation is complete, this entry is deleted, releasing the lock.

### Example DynamoDB Backend Configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "terraform/state.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"   # State locking is managed with DynamoDB
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

### Advantages of Using DynamoDB for State Locking:
- **Concurrency Control**: Prevents multiple users or automated systems from modifying the same Terraform state file concurrently.
- **Fault Tolerance**: If a Terraform process crashes while holding the lock, DynamoDB's TTL mechanism will automatically release the lock after a set period.
- **Scalability**: DynamoDB can handle a high number of lock requests, making it suitable for large teams or automated systems.
- **Low Overhead**: Locking with DynamoDB requires minimal provisioned throughput because lock contention is rare and typically involves a small number of read/write operations.

### Conclusion:
Terraform's integration with DynamoDB for state locking is a robust and scalable solution to ensure safe and consistent state management, particularly in environments where multiple users or systems interact with the same infrastructure. By ensuring only one process can make changes at a time, Terraform avoids conflicts and potential infrastructure drift.

What are other locking option beside dynamodb

Besides **DynamoDB**, there are several other locking mechanisms that can be used with Terraform to ensure state file consistency and prevent race conditions during concurrent runs. Here are a few options:

### 1. **Consul**:
   - **Overview**: Consul is a highly available and distributed key-value store that can be used for both service discovery and state locking. Terraform can use Consul to manage state and locking by storing the state in Consul KV and creating a lock to prevent concurrent operations.
   - **Pros**:
     - Can be deployed in multi-region, highly available environments.
     - Integrated monitoring and service discovery capabilities.
   - **Usage**: Typically used in conjunction with the Consul backend for state management.
   - **Example**:
     ```hcl
     terraform {
       backend "consul" {
         address = "consul.example.com:8500"
         path    = "terraform/state"
         lock    = true  # Enables state locking
       }
     }
     ```

### 2. **Etcd**:
   - **Overview**: Etcd is a distributed key-value store used for service discovery and configuration management, similar to Consul. It can be used for state locking by leveraging its distributed nature to manage lock states.
   - **Pros**:
     - High availability and strong consistency model.
     - Common in environments using Kubernetes (as etcd is a core component).
   - **Cons**:
     - More complex to set up compared to DynamoDB or Consul, especially for smaller teams or infrastructures.
   - **Usage**: Custom backend integration might be necessary as Terraform doesn’t natively support etcd for locking.

### 3. **PostgreSQL/MySQL**:
   - **Overview**: Both PostgreSQL and MySQL can be used for state locking when using a database backend. Terraform can store state and manage locking using database mechanisms like row-level locking.
   - **Pros**:
     - Useful if your infrastructure already has a database running for other purposes.
     - Centralized state and lock management.
   - **Cons**:
     - More complex than DynamoDB and might not be as scalable for large distributed systems.
   - **Example**:
     ```hcl
     terraform {
       backend "pg" {
         conn_str = "postgres://username:password@db.example.com/terraform"
         lock     = true  # Enables state locking using PostgreSQL
       }
     }
     ```

### 4. **Azure Blob Storage (with Azure State Locking)**:
   - **Overview**: When using Azure Blob Storage as the backend for state management, state locking is managed using Azure's native capabilities, such as exclusive blob leases. The lease prevents multiple concurrent operations on the state file.
   - **Pros**:
     - Fully integrated with Azure.
     - Simple setup for teams using Azure as their primary cloud provider.
   - **Cons**:
     - Limited to Azure environments.
   - **Example**:
     ```hcl
     terraform {
       backend "azurerm" {
         storage_account_name = "terraformstorage"
         container_name       = "tfstate"
         key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
         lock                 = true  # Native Azure locking mechanism
       }
     }
     ```

### 5. **Google Cloud Storage (with Object Locking)**:
   - **Overview**: Similar to Azure, Google Cloud Storage (GCS) can be used to store the Terraform state and implement locking using GCS object locks to prevent concurrent state changes.
   - **Pros**:
     - Integrated with Google Cloud Platform.
     - Simple for teams already using GCP.
   - **Cons**:
     - Limited to GCP environments.
   - **Example**:
     ```hcl
     terraform {
       backend "gcs" {
         bucket  = "my-gcs-bucket"
         prefix  = "terraform/state"
         lock    = true  # Native GCS object locking
       }
     }
     ```

### 6. **Git as a Backend (with Manual Locking)**:
   - **Overview**: Some teams use Git repositories to store Terraform state files. While this can work for version control, Git doesn't provide built-in state locking. Locking can be manually enforced by using PR processes or custom scripts to check for active changes.
   - **Pros**:
     - Useful in small teams where state is rarely modified concurrently.
     - Integrates with existing version control systems.
   - **Cons**:
     - No automatic locking; relies on manual processes or CI/CD systems.
   - **Usage**: You would need to write custom logic or CI/CD scripts for this option.

### 7. **File Backend (with Custom Locking)**:
   - **Overview**: The file backend stores state locally on disk or shared storage. Locking has to be manually implemented using file locks or external scripts.
   - **Pros**:
     - Simple to set up for local development.
   - **Cons**:
     - No built-in locking; not recommended for production or multi-user environments.
     - Not scalable for large teams or distributed environments.
   - **Usage**: You could use filesystem-level locks or custom scripts to implement basic locking.

### Comparison:
| **Locking Mechanism** | **Pros**                               | **Cons**                                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **DynamoDB**           | Native support, scalable               | AWS only                                |
| **Consul**             | Highly available, multi-region support | Requires a running Consul cluster       |
| **Etcd**               | Strong consistency, used with Kubernetes | Complex setup                           |
| **PostgreSQL/MySQL**   | Centralized, robust                    | Complex setup, less scalable            |
| **Azure Blob**         | Native Azure support                   | Limited to Azure environments           |
| **Google Cloud Storage** | Native GCP support                   | Limited to GCP environments             |
| **Git (Manual Locking)** | Simple for small teams, version-controlled | No automatic locking                    |
| **File Backend**       | Simple for local use                   | No built-in locking, not scalable       |

### Conclusion:
- **DynamoDB** is the most common option for state locking, especially when using AWS S3 for state storage.
- **Consul** and **etcd** are good options for distributed infrastructures that need more flexibility.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL** and cloud-native solutions like **Azure Blob** or **Google Cloud Storage** provide viable alternatives depending on your environment.

The best solution depends on your infrastructure needs, the cloud provider you use, and the complexity of your Terraform environment.

What about terraform state beside s3 backend?

### Conclusion:
While **S3** is the most common backend for state management, Terraform offers a wide variety of backends to accommodate different infrastructure needs and platforms. You should choose a backend based on your environment (cloud provider or on-premises), collaboration needs, and operational scale.

Repeat again terraform configuration on ec2 creation with s3 backend and dynamodb state lock with tfvars in s3 also

Here's a Terraform configuration to **create an EC2 instance**, store the **Terraform state in S3**, use **DynamoDB for state locking**, and also store Terraform **variables in S3** using the `tfvars` file. This configuration ensures safe state management by preventing concurrent updates using DynamoDB as a locking mechanism and also simplifies variable management by keeping the `tfvars` file in an S3 bucket.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **EC2 Creation**: We define the AWS EC2 instance resource.
2. **S3 Backend**: The state is stored in an S3 bucket.
3. **DynamoDB Locking**: We use DynamoDB to ensure state locking.
4. **tfvars in S3**: The `tfvars` file is uploaded to an S3 bucket and then fetched by Terraform.

### Configuration:

#### 1. **Terraform Backend Setup with S3 and DynamoDB**

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"  # Name of your S3 bucket
    key            = "terraform/state.tfstate"    # Path to the state file
    region         = "us-west-2"                  # AWS region for the S3 bucket
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"            # DynamoDB table for state locking
    encrypt        = true                         # Enable encryption for state file
  }
}

# AWS provider setup
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"   # Specify the AWS region
}
```

#### 2. **Create the EC2 Instance**

```hcl
# Create an EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = var.ami_id                    # Use the AMI ID from tfvars file
  instance_type = var.instance_type             # Use the instance type from tfvars file

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform EC2 Instance"
  }
}

# Output the public IP of the EC2 instance
output "instance_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}
```

#### 3. **Upload `terraform.tfvars` to S3**

You can store your `terraform.tfvars` file in S3. To fetch it during the Terraform run, we’ll use a data source to retrieve the contents.

First, upload the `terraform.tfvars` file to an S3 bucket:

```bash
aws s3 cp terraform.tfvars s3://my-tfvars-bucket/terraform.tfvars
```

The `terraform.tfvars` file contains the following variables:

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars file
ami_id         = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
instance_type  = "t2.micro"
```

#### 4. **Retrieve `terraform.tfvars` from S3**

In your Terraform configuration, use the following to download the `tfvars` file from S3:

```hcl
data "aws_s3_bucket_object" "tfvars" {
  bucket = "my-tfvars-bucket"
  key    = "terraform.tfvars"
}

locals {
  tfvars_content = filebase64decode(data.aws_s3_bucket_object.tfvars.body)
}

# Load variables from the decoded tfvars content
variable "ami_id" {}
variable "instance_type" {}

# Read variables from the local data source
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}
```

### 5. **Create the S3 Bucket and DynamoDB Table**

You must create the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table if they don’t already exist. You can do this using the AWS CLI:

#### Create the S3 Bucket for State:
```bash
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-terraform-state-bucket --region us-west-2
```

#### Create the DynamoDB Table for Locking:
```bash
aws dynamodb create-table \
    --table-name terraform-locks \
    --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S \
    --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH \
    --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5 \
    --region us-west-2
```

#### Create the S3 Bucket for `tfvars`:
```bash
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-tfvars-bucket --region us-west-2
```

### Apply the Configuration:

Run the following commands to initialize Terraform and apply the configuration:

1. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Apply the Terraform Plan**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

This will:
- Fetch the `terraform.tfvars` file from S3.
- Create an EC2 instance based on the variables in the `tfvars` file.
- Store the state file in S3.
- Ensure state locking using DynamoDB during the `apply` operation.

### Summary:
- **State File in S3**: Terraform's state file is securely stored in an S3 bucket.
- **State Locking in DynamoDB**: DynamoDB prevents concurrent operations by locking the state file.
- **tfvars from S3**: Terraform fetches the `tfvars` file from S3 to configure the EC2 instance with dynamic variables.

How do i create a test for terraform module taking user-input yaml declarative file for parameters to create kubernetes pods

To create a test for a Terraform module that takes a user-input YAML declarative file as parameters to create Kubernetes pods, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Setup for Unit Testing with `terraform` and `terratest`**
   - **Terratest** is a popular Go testing framework for Terraform, and it can be used to run automated tests against your Terraform modules. The testing will focus on verifying that the Kubernetes pods are created correctly using the values from the YAML file.
   
### 2. **Use a Sample YAML Input**
   First, create a sample YAML file that will be passed as an input to your Terraform module.

#### Example YAML file (`k8s_pod.yaml`):
```yaml
pod:
  name: "test-pod"
  image: "nginx"
  namespace: "default"
  labels:
    app: "test"
  container_port: 80
```

### 3. **Terraform Module for Kubernetes Pod Creation**

Create a Terraform module that reads parameters from the YAML file to create a Kubernetes Pod.

#### Example Terraform Module (`main.tf`):
```hcl
# Read YAML file
data "yaml_decode" "pod_config" {
  content = file("${path.module}/k8s_pod.yaml")
}

# Kubernetes provider configuration
provider "kubernetes" {
  config_path = "~/.kube/config"
}

# Create a Kubernetes Pod based on the YAML input
resource "kubernetes_pod" "example" {
  metadata {
    name      = data.yaml_decode.pod_config.pod.name
    namespace = data.yaml_decode.pod_config.pod.namespace
    labels = data.yaml_decode.pod_config.pod.labels
  }

  spec {
    container {
      image = data.yaml_decode.pod_config.pod.image
      name  = "nginx"
      port {
        container_port = data.yaml_decode.pod_config.pod.container_port
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this Terraform configuration:
- The **YAML file** is read using the `yaml_decode` function, and its contents are used to configure a Kubernetes pod resource.
- The **Kubernetes provider** creates a pod based on the parsed YAML input.

### 4. **Writing a Test with Terratest**

To automate the testing of this Terraform module, use Terratest to deploy the pod and verify its creation. The test checks if the Kubernetes pod is successfully created and configured according to the YAML file parameters.

#### Example Test (`terraform_k8s_test.go`):

1. Install `terratest` using Go:
   ```bash
   go get github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform
   go get github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/k8s
   ```

2. Create the test file:

```go
package test

import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/k8s"
    "github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
    corev1 "k8s.io/api/core/v1"
)

func TestKubernetesPod(t *testing.T) {
    // Specify the path to the Terraform code
    terraformOptions := terraform.WithDefaultRetryableErrors(t, &terraform.Options{
        TerraformDir: "../terraform-k8s-pod-module",  // path to your module
    })

    // Ensure Terraform is applied and destroyed properly
    defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)
    terraform.InitAndApply(t, terraformOptions)

    // Configure kubectl options for interacting with Kubernetes
    kubeOptions := k8s.NewKubectlOptions("", "~/.kube/config", "default")

    // Verify the pod is created
    pod := k8s.GetPod(t, kubeOptions, "test-pod")
    
    // Check if the Pod is running
    assert.Equal(t, corev1.PodRunning, pod.Status.Phase)

    // Verify pod metadata and container configurations from YAML
    assert.Equal(t, "test", pod.Labels["app"])
    assert.Equal(t, "nginx", pod.Spec.Containers[0].Image)
    assert.Equal(t, int32(80), pod.Spec.Containers[0].Ports[0].ContainerPort)
}
```

### 5. **Running the Test**
To run the test, execute the following command in your test directory:

```bash
go test -v
```

### Explanation of the Test:
- **`terraform.InitAndApply(t, terraformOptions)`**: Runs the Terraform commands to deploy the Kubernetes pod.
- **`k8s.GetPod(t, kubeOptions, "test-pod")`**: Fetches the created pod from Kubernetes.
- **Assertions**: Verifies that the pod is running and that its attributes (labels, image, port) match the expected values from the YAML file.

### 6. **Clean Up**
- The `defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)` ensures that Terraform will clean up the resources after the test runs.

### Conclusion:
This testing approach validates that the Terraform module correctly creates Kubernetes pods based on user input from a YAML file. It uses Terratest to deploy the infrastructure and assert that the pod is configured as expected, which ensures your module behaves as intended in real-world scenarios.

how do I create a combination of test lab on mac with terraform, ansible, and kubernetes.

To create a test lab on your Mac using **Terraform**, **Ansible**, and **Kubernetes**, you will set up a local environment that allows you to manage infrastructure using Terraform, configure it with Ansible, and deploy applications on a Kubernetes cluster. This is a multi-step process that combines local virtualization, containerization, and automation tools.

### Steps to Set Up the Test Lab:

#### 1. **Install Prerequisites on Mac**
You need to install the essential tools to manage infrastructure and container orchestration. These include:

- **Homebrew**: If you don’t have Homebrew installed, it’s the easiest way to install packages on macOS.
  
  ```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```

- **Docker**: Install Docker for Mac, which includes Docker and Kubernetes.

  ```bash
  brew install --cask docker
  ```

  Enable Kubernetes in Docker by going to Docker Desktop > Preferences > Kubernetes and enable the Kubernetes cluster.

- **Minikube**: If you prefer a lightweight Kubernetes solution without Docker, you can install Minikube.
  
  ```bash
  brew install minikube
  minikube start
  ```

- **Terraform**: Install Terraform to manage infrastructure as code.

  ```bash
  brew install terraform
  ```

- **Ansible**: Install Ansible to automate server configuration and application deployments.

  ```bash
  brew install ansible
  ```

#### 2. **Set Up a Virtualization Environment (Optional)**
If you want to use virtual machines for your test lab instead of Docker containers, you can use **VirtualBox** or **VMware Fusion**.

- **VirtualBox**:
  ```bash
  brew install --cask virtualbox
  ```

- **VMware Fusion**:
  ```bash
  brew install --cask vmware-fusion
  ```

#### 3. **Create Infrastructure with Terraform**

You can use Terraform to provision infrastructure locally, such as virtual machines (with VirtualBox) or a cloud provider. Below is an example of provisioning a VM using VirtualBox:

**Terraform configuration (`main.tf`):**

```hcl
provider "virtualbox" {}

resource "virtualbox_vm" "example" {
  name   = "ubuntu-vm"
  image  = "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/bionic/current/bionic-server-cloudimg-amd64.ova"
  cpus   = 2
  memory = "1024 mib"

  network_adapter {
    type           = "nat"
    nat_driver     = "virtio"
  }
}

output "ip" {
  value = virtualbox_vm.example.network_adapter[0].ip_address
}
```

1. **Initialize Terraform**:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Apply the Terraform Configuration**:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   This will create a VirtualBox VM with the specified configuration.

#### 4. **Configure VMs or Kubernetes Nodes with Ansible**

After creating infrastructure with Terraform, you can use Ansible to configure the VMs or nodes. Here’s how to use Ansible to configure Kubernetes nodes:

**Ansible Playbook (`k8s_playbook.yaml`):**

```yaml
---
- hosts: kubernetes
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Docker
      apt:
        name: docker.io
        state: present
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install Kubernetes packages
      apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
        update_cache: yes
      loop:
        - kubelet
        - kubeadm
        - kubectl
```

Create an inventory file (`inventory.ini`):

```ini
[kubernetes]
192.168.99.100 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Run the Ansible playbook to configure your Kubernetes nodes:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini k8s_playbook.yaml
```

#### 5. **Deploy Applications on Kubernetes**

Once your Kubernetes cluster is up and running, you can deploy applications using Terraform and Kubernetes providers.

**Terraform configuration to deploy a Kubernetes pod (`main.tf`):**

```hcl
provider "kubernetes" {
  config_path = "~/.kube/config"
}

resource "kubernetes_pod" "nginx" {
  metadata {
    name = "nginx"
    labels = {
      app = "nginx"
    }
  }
  spec {
    container {
      image = "nginx"
      name  = "nginx"
      port {
        container_port = 80
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Apply the configuration to deploy the pod:

```bash
terraform apply
```

#### 6. **Test Your Kubernetes Environment**

To verify that the Kubernetes pod was deployed successfully, use the `kubectl` command:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

You should see the `nginx` pod running in your cluster.

### Summary Workflow:
1. **Terraform**: Used to provision infrastructure (VMs, cloud instances, or Kubernetes clusters).
2. **Ansible**: Used to configure the machines or Kubernetes nodes after they have been provisioned.
3. **Kubernetes**: Used to deploy and manage containerized applications. Terraform can also be used to automate application deployment on Kubernetes.

This setup gives you a powerful test lab on macOS for learning and automating infrastructure with Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes.

what is the best way to test terraform module and logic in mac?

The best way to test a Terraform module and its logic on a Mac is to use a combination of **local testing tools**, **integration testing frameworks**, and **best practices** for infrastructure-as-code. Here’s a recommended approach:

### 1. **Local Development Environment Setup**

Before testing your Terraform module, ensure you have the necessary tools installed on your Mac:

- **Terraform**: 
  ```bash
  brew install terraform
  ```

- **Terratest (for Integration Testing)**: 
  Terratest is a Go-based testing framework that helps you write automated tests for Terraform. It supports unit and integration testing, making it ideal for testing infrastructure code.

  Install Go first:
  ```bash
  brew install go
  ```

  Then, you can add Terratest dependencies to your Go project:
  ```bash
  go get github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform
  go get github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/k8s
  ```

### 2. **Unit Testing with Terraform Validate and Linting**

**Terraform Validate**:
- Use `terraform validate` to check if your Terraform module's syntax and configuration are correct.
  
  ```bash
  terraform init  # Initialize the module
  terraform validate
  ```

**Terraform Fmt**:
- Use `terraform fmt` to ensure your code follows Terraform's style guidelines.

  ```bash
  terraform fmt -check
  ```

**TFLint**:
- Use **TFLint** for more detailed checks, such as best practices, potential security issues, and provider-specific checks. Install it via Homebrew:
  
  ```bash
  brew install tflint
  ```

  Run it on your Terraform files:
  
  ```bash
  tflint
  ```

### 3. **Integration Testing with Terratest**

**Terratest** allows you to write Go tests that execute your Terraform code and verify the expected behavior of the resources created. Here’s how to use it:

1. **Write a Simple Terratest Go File (`terraform_test.go`)**:

   ```go
   package test

   import (
       "testing"
       "github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform"
       "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
   )

   func TestTerraformModule(t *testing.T) {
       terraformOptions := &terraform.Options{
           TerraformDir: "../path-to-your-module",  // Path to the Terraform module
       }

       defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)
       terraform.InitAndApply(t, terraformOptions)

       output := terraform.Output(t, terraformOptions, "output_name")  // Change 'output_name'
       assert.Equal(t, "expected_value", output)
   }
   ```

2. **Run the Test**:
   You can run the test using the `go test` command:

   ```bash
   go test -v
   ```

   This will initialize, apply, and verify your Terraform module using the assertions defined in the test.

### 4. **Use `terraform plan` for Local Testing**

Running `terraform plan` helps you see what changes Terraform will make without actually applying them. This is useful for testing your logic:

```bash
terraform plan
```

### 5. **Simulate Environment Variables**

Many Terraform modules use environment variables for configuration. On a Mac, you can easily set environment variables for testing by exporting them before running tests:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
```

Then run your Terraform commands as usual, and the module will use these environment variables.

### 6. **Use Docker for Local Kubernetes or Cloud Services**

For modules that interact with **Kubernetes** or other cloud services, you can use **Docker** to simulate these environments. You can run a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube or use Docker Compose to simulate cloud-like environments.

- **Minikube**: For Kubernetes testing.
  ```bash
  brew install minikube
  minikube start
  ```

- **Localstack**: To mock AWS services for local testing.
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -it -p 4566:4566 localstack/localstack
  ```

### 7. **Testing Best Practices**
- **Isolate Each Test**: Make sure each test is independent of others to avoid shared state.
- **Test Idempotency**: Verify that running `terraform apply` multiple times produces the same result.
- **Destroy Resources After Test**: Always clean up resources by using `terraform destroy` in the test or after manual testing.

### Summary of Steps:
1. Install necessary tools (Terraform, Go, TFLint).
2. Validate and lint your Terraform configuration.
3. Use Terratest for automated integration testing.
4. Use `terraform plan` for local testing without applying changes.
5. Simulate environment variables and cloud services with Docker/Minikube for specific cloud tests.
6. Follow best practices to ensure repeatable and clean tests.

By combining these steps, you can create a comprehensive testing workflow for your Terraform modules on macOS, ensuring both functionality and reliability.

give me few test plans, I should be able to test terraform reading a user-input yaml file to create resource.

When testing a Terraform module that reads a user-input YAML file to create resources, it is crucial to create test plans that validate multiple aspects of the module's functionality. Below are a few test plans that can help ensure that your Terraform module is correctly reading the YAML file and provisioning the expected resources.

### 1. **Test Plan: Validate YAML Input Parsing**
   **Objective**: Verify that the Terraform module correctly parses the user-input YAML file and extracts the required parameters to create resources.

   - **Preconditions**:
     - The YAML file contains valid configurations for creating the resource (e.g., Kubernetes pods, AWS EC2 instances).
     - The Terraform module has access to the YAML file.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Create a simple YAML file with minimal parameters (e.g., name, image, port).
     2. Run `terraform plan` and check the Terraform plan output for resource creation.
     3. Assert that the parsed values match the expected values in the YAML file.
   
   - **Expected Outcome**:
     - Terraform correctly reads the values from the YAML file and displays the correct configurations in the plan output.

   - **Example Test Input (YAML)**:
     ```yaml
     resource:
       name: "test-resource"
       type: "pod"
       image: "nginx"
       port: 80
     ```

   - **Expected Output**:
     Terraform plan should show a Kubernetes pod with the name `test-resource`, running the `nginx` image on port 80.

---

### 2. **Test Plan: Handle Invalid YAML Inputs**
   **Objective**: Ensure that the Terraform module handles errors gracefully when the user provides an invalid or malformed YAML file.

   - **Preconditions**:
     - The YAML file is malformed or missing required parameters (e.g., incorrect syntax, missing fields).

   - **Steps**:
     1. Create a YAML file with incorrect syntax (e.g., unclosed brackets).
     2. Run `terraform plan` and observe any error messages or warnings.
     3. Check if the error message clearly indicates the issue with the YAML file.

   - **Expected Outcome**:
     - Terraform should fail gracefully, outputting an error message that indicates the YAML file format is invalid or missing required fields.

   - **Example Test Input (YAML)**:
     ```yaml
     resource:
       name: "invalid-resource"
       image: "nginx"
       # Missing closing bracket or other required fields
     ```

   - **Expected Output**:
     Terraform should return an error indicating that the YAML file is not valid, specifying the line or field where the error occurs.

---

### 3. **Test Plan: Cross-Check Resource Creation with YAML Parameters**
   **Objective**: Ensure that the resources created by Terraform match the specifications provided in the YAML file.

   - **Preconditions**:
     - Terraform has access to a valid YAML file with the necessary resource specifications.
     - Resources will be created in a real or mock environment.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Create a YAML file with detailed parameters for resource creation (e.g., name, image, labels, annotations).
     2. Run `terraform apply` to create the resource.
     3. Use relevant CLI commands (e.g., `kubectl`, `aws`, etc.) to check the resource properties.
     4. Cross-check that the resource properties match the YAML parameters.

   - **Expected Outcome**:
     - The created resource should exactly match the details specified in the YAML file.

   - **Example Test Input (YAML)**:
     ```yaml
     resource:
       name: "web-server"
       type: "pod"
       image: "nginx:latest"
       labels:
         app: "web"
         tier: "frontend"
     ```

   - **Expected Output**:
     Use the command `kubectl get pod web-server -o yaml` to verify that the labels, image, and name match the specifications in the YAML.

---

### 4. **Test Plan: Test Module Idempotency with YAML Changes**
   **Objective**: Ensure that Terraform is idempotent when changes are made to the YAML file, meaning it should only update the resource if the YAML file changes.

   - **Preconditions**:
     - A valid resource is already created from the previous YAML input.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Modify a parameter in the YAML file (e.g., update the image version from `nginx:latest` to `nginx:1.18`).
     2. Run `terraform apply` again.
     3. Check the resource to ensure only the changed parameter (image) is updated while other attributes remain unchanged.

   - **Expected Outcome**:
     - Only the modified field (image version) should be updated. The resource name and other parameters should remain the same.

   - **Example Test Input (YAML)**:
     ```yaml
     resource:
       name: "web-server"
       type: "pod"
       image: "nginx:1.18"
     ```

   - **Expected Output**:
     The Kubernetes pod should now run `nginx:1.18`, but the pod name and other parameters should remain unchanged.

---

### 5. **Test Plan: Test Default Values in Module Logic**
   **Objective**: Verify that the module correctly assigns default values when some parameters are missing from the user-input YAML file.

   - **Preconditions**:
     - A YAML file is provided with some optional parameters omitted.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Create a YAML file that omits certain optional fields (e.g., container ports, resource limits).
     2. Run `terraform apply`.
     3. Check if the resources are created with the default values for the omitted parameters.
   
   - **Expected Outcome**:
     - Terraform should create the resource, and default values should be applied where parameters were missing in the YAML file.

   - **Example Test Input (YAML)**:
     ```yaml
     resource:
       name: "default-server"
       type: "pod"
       image: "nginx"
     ```

   - **Expected Output**:
     Terraform should create a Kubernetes pod with the default container port (e.g., port 80) and resource limits if those were defined as defaults in the module.

---

### 6. **Test Plan: Test Integration with Remote YAML Sources**
   **Objective**: Ensure that the Terraform module can read YAML files from remote sources (e.g., S3, HTTP URL) and correctly apply the configurations.

   - **Preconditions**:
     - The YAML file is stored in a remote location (e.g., S3 bucket or HTTP URL).

   - **Steps**:
     1. Store the YAML file in a remote source (e.g., S3 bucket or web server).
     2. Modify the Terraform module to fetch the YAML file from the remote source.
     3. Run `terraform apply`.
     4. Verify that the resource is created as per the remote YAML file.

   - **Expected Outcome**:
     - Terraform should successfully read the YAML from the remote location and create resources accordingly.

   - **Example Test Input (Remote YAML Location)**:
     ```hcl
     data "http" "yaml_source" {
       url = "https://my-server.com/k8s-config.yaml"
     }

     locals {
       yaml_config = yaml_decode(data.http.yaml_source.body)
     }

     resource "kubernetes_pod" "remote" {
       metadata {
         name = local.yaml_config.resource.name
       }
       spec {
         container {
           image = local.yaml_config.resource.image
         }
       }
     }
     ```

   - **Expected Output**:
     The resource (e.g., Kubernetes pod) is created based on the remote YAML configuration.

### Conclusion:
These test plans cover different aspects of your Terraform module's functionality. They help ensure the module correctly parses user-input YAML files, handles errors, applies changes, and integrates with remote YAML sources. Automated testing using **Terratest** can further streamline the validation process.
