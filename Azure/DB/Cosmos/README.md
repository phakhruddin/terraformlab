üöÄ **Next Steps: Integrating Azure Function to Write Data to Cosmos DB (MongoDB API)**


---

## **üõ† Plan**
1. **Create an Azure Function** (Python-based) that listens to HTTP requests.
2. **Parse incoming JSON data** and write it to **Cosmos DB**.
3. **Deploy the function** using **Terraform** and store the function code in **Azure Blob Storage**.
4. **Test the Function** via `curl` or a REST client.

---

## **üìå Terraform Configuration**
We will create:
- **Azure Function App** (`func-write-cosmos`)
- **Blob Storage** for function deployment
- **Function Code** to insert data into CosmosDB

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform**
Add this to your **Terraform `main.tf`**:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "cosmos_rg" {
  name     = "cosmos-resource-group"
  location = "West US 2"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "func_storage" {
  name                     = "funcstoragewrite"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.cosmos_rg.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.cosmos_rg.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_container" "func_container" {
  name                  = "function-code"
  storage_account_name  = azurerm_storage_account.func_storage.name
  container_access_type = "private"
}

resource "azurerm_service_plan" "function_plan" {
  name                = "func-write-plan"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.cosmos_rg.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.cosmos_rg.location
  os_type             = "Linux"
  sku_name            = "Y1" # Consumption plan
}

resource "azurerm_linux_function_app" "func_write" {
  name                       = "func-write-cosmos"
  resource_group_name        = azurerm_resource_group.cosmos_rg.name
  location                   = azurerm_resource_group.cosmos_rg.location
  service_plan_id            = azurerm_service_plan.function_plan.id
  storage_account_name       = azurerm_storage_account.func_storage.name
  storage_account_access_key = azurerm_storage_account.func_storage.primary_access_key
  app_settings = {
    "COSMOS_CONNECTION_STRING" = azurerm_cosmosdb_account.cosmos_account.primary_master_key
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME" = "python"
    "AzureWebJobsStorage"      = azurerm_storage_account.func_storage.primary_connection_string
  }
}

resource "azurerm_storage_blob" "function_code_blob" {
  name                   = "write-function.zip"
  storage_account_name   = azurerm_storage_account.func_storage.name
  storage_container_name = azurerm_storage_container.func_container.name
  type                   = "Block"
  source                 = "write-function.zip"  # Ensure this zip exists locally before running terraform apply
}
```

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Function Code (Python)**
Create the **Azure Function app code** in a folder called `write-function`:

**`write-function/__init__.py`**
```python
import logging
import azure.functions as func
import pymongo
import os
import json

def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    logging.info("Received a request to insert data into Cosmos DB.")

    try:
        req_body = req.get_json()
    except ValueError:
        return func.HttpResponse("Invalid JSON payload", status_code=400)

    connection_string = os.environ["COSMOS_CONNECTION_STRING"]
    client = pymongo.MongoClient(connection_string)
    database = client["deen-mongo-db"]
    collection = database["deen-collection"]

    collection.insert_one(req_body)
    
    return func.HttpResponse(f"Data inserted: {json.dumps(req_body)}", status_code=200)
```

**`write-function/requirements.txt`**
```
azure-functions
pymongo[srv]
```

**Zip the function:**
```sh
cd write-function
zip -r ../write-function.zip .
cd ..
```

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Apply Terraform**
Now, deploy everything:
```sh
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

---

```sh
terraform apply --auto-approve

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Function**
Once the deployment is done, get the **function URL**:
```sh
az functionapp function show \
  --name func-write-cosmos \
  --resource-group cosmos-resource-group \
  --query "invokeUrlTemplate" -o tsv
```

#### **Send a test request**
```sh
curl -X POST "https://func-write-cosmos.azurewebsites.net/api/insert" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Azure Function", "type": "demo"}'
```

### **üöÄ What's Next?**
‚úÖ **Verify Data in Cosmos DB**
Run:
```sh
mongosh "mongodb://adminuser:YourPassword@deen-cosmos-account.mongo.cosmos.azure.com:10255/?tls=true&replicaSet=globaldb&retrywrites=false" --eval 'db.deen-collection.find().pretty()'
```
