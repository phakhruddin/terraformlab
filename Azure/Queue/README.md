### 🚀 **Scenario: Processing Background Tasks with Azure Queue Storage and Azure Function**

## **🛠 Overview**
We will create an **Azure Queue Storage** to store tasks, and an **Azure Function** that listens to the queue and processes the messages. This is useful for **asynchronous processing**, such as:
- **Image processing**
- **Data transformation**
- **Background task execution**

---

## **📌 Plan**
1. **Create an Azure Queue Storage** (to enqueue messages)
2. **Deploy an Azure Function** that triggers on new queue messages
3. **Process the message inside the function**
4. **Test by sending messages and observing logs**
5. **Store function code in Azure Blob Storage**

---

## **📝 1️⃣ Terraform Configuration**
### **🔹 Define Infrastructure in `main.tf`**
```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "queue_rg" {
  name     = "queue-resource-group"
  location = "West US 2"
}

# 🔹 Create Storage Account for Queue
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "queue_storage" {
  name                     = "queueprocessstorage"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.queue_rg.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.queue_rg.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

# 🔹 Create a Queue inside Storage Account
resource "azurerm_storage_queue" "task_queue" {
  name                 = "task-queue"
  storage_account_name = azurerm_storage_account.queue_storage.name
}

# 🔹 Create Function App Service Plan
resource "azurerm_service_plan" "function_plan" {
  name                = "queue-function-plan"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.queue_rg.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.queue_rg.location
  os_type             = "Linux"
  sku_name            = "Y1" # Consumption plan
}

# 🔹 Create Function App (without ZIP file upload)
resource "azurerm_linux_function_app" "queue_function" {
  name                       = "func-queue-processor"
  resource_group_name        = azurerm_resource_group.queue_rg.name
  location                   = azurerm_resource_group.queue_rg.location
  service_plan_id            = azurerm_service_plan.function_plan.id
  storage_account_name       = azurerm_storage_account.queue_storage.name
  storage_account_access_key = azurerm_storage_account.queue_storage.primary_access_key

  app_settings = {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage"       = azurerm_storage_account.queue_storage.primary_connection_string
    "QUEUE_NAME"                = azurerm_storage_queue.task_queue.name
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME"  = "python"
  }
}
```

```sh
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

      "queueName": "task-queue",
      "connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage"
    }
  ]
}
```

📄 **`queue-function/requirements.txt`**
```
azure-functions
```

---

## **📦 3️⃣ Package Function Locally**
```sh
cd queue-function
zip -r ../queue-function.zip .
cd ..
```

---

## **🚀 4️⃣ Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform**
```sh
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

---

## **📡 5️⃣ Deploy the Function Code Using `az`**
```sh
az functionapp deployment source config-zip \
  --resource-group queue-resource-group \
  --name func-queue-processor \
  --src queue-function.zip
```

---

## **🚀 6️⃣ Send a Test Message**
Once deployed, send a message to the queue:
```sh
az storage message put \
  --account-name queueprocessstorage \
  --queue-name task-queue \
  --content "Process this task"
```

Check the **Azure Function Logs**:
```sh
az functionapp log tail --name func-queue-processor --resource-group queue-resource-group
```

---

## **✅ Expected Output**
In logs, you should see:
```
Processing task: Process this task
```

---

## **🚀 Next Steps**
- 🔹 Automate ZIP deployment with a **GitHub Action** or **CI/CD pipeline**.
- 🔹 Add **more processing logic**, such as **database writes**.
- 🔹 Use **Service Bus** instead of Queue Storage for more advanced messaging.

---

## **🚀 Next Steps**
- 🔹 Integrate **Event Grid** to trigger processing when data is uploaded
- 🔹 Store **processed results in Cosmos DB**
- 🔹 Use **Service Bus** for more advanced messaging
