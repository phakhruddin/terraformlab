### üöÄ **Scenario: Processing Background Tasks with Azure Queue Storage and Azure Function**

## **üõ† Overview**
We will create an **Azure Queue Storage** to store tasks, and an **Azure Function** that listens to the queue and processes the messages. This is useful for **asynchronous processing**, such as:
- **Image processing**
- **Data transformation**
- **Background task execution**

---

## **üìå Plan**
1. **Create an Azure Queue Storage** (to enqueue messages)
2. **Deploy an Azure Function** that triggers on new queue messages
3. **Process the message inside the function**
4. **Test by sending messages and observing logs**
5. **Store function code in Azure Blob Storage**

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Terraform Configuration**
### **Define Infrastructure in `main.tf`**
```hcl

# Create Function App Service Plan

  os_type             = "Linux"
  sku_name            = "Y1" # Consumption plan
}

# Create Function App (without ZIP file upload)
resource "azurerm_linux_function_app" "queue_function" {
  name                       = "func-queue-processor"
  resource_group_name        = azurerm_resource_group.queue_rg.name
  location                   = azurerm_resource_group.queue_rg.location
  service_plan_id            = azurerm_service_plan.function_plan.id
  storage_account_name       = azurerm_storage_account.queue_storage.name
  storage_account_access_key = azurerm_storage_account.queue_storage.primary_access_key

  app_settings = {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage"       = azurerm_storage_account.queue_storage.primary_connection_string

```sh
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

```

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Package Function Locally**
```sh
cd queue-function
zip -r ../queue-function.zip .
cd ..
```

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform**
```sh
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

---

##5Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy the Function Code Using `az`**
```sh
az functionapp deployment source config-zip \
  --resource-group queue-resource-group \
  --name func-queue-processor \
  --src queue-function.zip
```

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Send a Test Message**
Once deployed, send a message to the queue:
```sh
az storage message put \
  --account-name queueprocessstorage \
  --queue-name task-queue \
  --content "Process this task"
```

Check the **Azure Function Logs**:
```sh
az functionapp log tail --name func-queue-processor --resource-group queue-resource-group
```

---

## **‚úÖ Expected Output**
In logs, you should see:
```
Processing task: Process this task
```

---

## **üöÄ Next Steps**
-  Automate ZIP deployment with a **GitHub Action** or **CI/CD pipeline**.
-  Add **more processing logic**, such as **database writes**.
-  Use **Service Bus** instead of Queue Storage for more advanced messaging.

---

## **üöÄ Next Steps**
-  Integrate **Event Grid** to trigger processing when data is uploaded
-  Store **processed results in Cosmos DB**
-  Use **Service Bus** for more advanced messaging
