Terraform configuration creates a simple setup with an Azure Application Gateway (Azure's equivalent of an ALB) that serves a "Hello World" page from an NGINX backend. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Resource Group**: Creates a container for all resources
2. **Networking**: 
   - Virtual network with three subnets (frontend, backend, and one for the Application Gateway)
   - Public IPs for both the Application Gateway and the VM
   - Network security group allowing HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22)

3. **VM with NGINX**:
   - Creates a small Ubuntu VM (B1s size to keep costs low)
   - Uses custom data script to install NGINX and create a simple "Hello World" page
   - Connects to the backend subnet

4. **Application Gateway (ALB)**:
   - Standard_v2 tier (the most common choice)
   - Configured with a public IP
   - HTTP listener on port 80
   - Backend pool pointing to the NGINX VM's private IP
   - Basic routing rule to direct traffic to the NGINX server

5. **Outputs**:
   - The URL to access your Application Gateway
   - The VM's public IP (for SSH access)
   - The name of the backend pool

To deploy this:

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Review the plan
terraform plan

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply
```

After deployment (which takes about 15-20 minutes, mainly for the Application Gateway provisioning), you'll be able to access the "Hello World" page by navigating to the Application Gateway's public IP in your browser.

**Important Notes:**
1. Replace the SSH key path (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) with your actual public key location
2. For better security, restrict SSH access to your IP address in the security rule
3. This is a minimal setup - for production, consider adding:
   - HTTPS with SSL termination
   - Health probes
   - Multiple backend instances
   - Network security for the Application Gateway
